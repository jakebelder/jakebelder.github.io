Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/MQxRcN">Paul’s Powerpoint to the Corinthians</a></strong> – Everyone has been subject to a terrible Powerpoint presentation at one time or another.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dlmfno">Vanhoozer on the Canaanite Conquest</a></strong> – Many of those who object to Christianity ask questions like, "How can a loving God command genocide like he did in the Old Testament?" It's a difficult question that our modern minds struggle with, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Vanhoozer">Kevin Vanhoozer</a> here offers a very helpful answer.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1fJZu0L">Lights, Camera, Pulpit!</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Tommyhinson">Tommy Hinson</a>, in this helpful article, offers some tips from screenwriting that apply to preachers as well.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1c2tQaK">Hear Me Out: On Sitting Through Sermons</a></strong> – Here is an excellent post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> on why sermons are not just for those who learn by hearing. He writes, "The physical act of attending a sermon has something to teach everyone. Whether or not you think that you are learning anything, it is shaping you in significant ways."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lAtTEc">The God of Criticism</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> has a brief observation on how critical scholars "accomplish the near-miraculous: They make Yahweh boring."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1duFgns">Baptist baptism trouble</a></strong> – Here is an interesting observation from <a href="http://twitter.com/PastorSteveJeff">Steve Jeffrey</a> on children raised in Christian families, and a particular problem it raises for baptists. He notes, "The baptist paradigm of <em>faithful</em> covenant parents raising <em>unbelieving</em> kids until those kids come to faith later in life is entirely absent from the Bible."</li>
