Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

This should have published yesterday, but there were some server issues. So, here are the links from <strong>08-14 September 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ez1WGZ">When Power Goes to Your Head</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/rjoustra">Rob Joustra</a> pens a very interesting post on the effects of holding power and the need for Christians to reflect on this. He writes, 'The practice of holding power is therefore not a neutral one. Power does things to us, whether we’re aware of it or not.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ez28WN">Abuse Does Not Take Away Use</a></strong> – I've only recently come across <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a>, but I am finding much of what he writes to be very helpful, such as this piece here. He discusses the idea that the abuse of Scripture and theology does not take away its use, and concludes, 'Jesus teaches us that we must strive to distinguish true doctrines of the Christian faith from their distorted applications and expositions.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17vbC1i">Martin Luther on Baptizing Babies</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulBurkhart_">Paul Burkhart</a> quotes Martin Luther, who makes the point that we baptise because of God's command to do so, and not because of our own confession.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17viEDh">Why Steve Jobs wanted you to go to Bible College</a></strong> – This is an interesting post on why learning in community is so profitable. Steve Jobs apparently thought the ideal work place was one where employees had many opportunities for interaction with each other, and <a href="http://twitter.com/afaithtoliveby">Neil Powell</a> suggests this same principle is a good reason for residential theological study.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://derekzrishmawy.com/2013/09/13/you-didnt-talk-about-or-its-just-a-blog-post/">“You Didn’t Talk About….” (Or, It’s Just a Blog Post)</a></strong> – Derek Rishmawy has another good post this week on why blog posts don't need to say everything, and some of the underlying issues behind commenters who think they should.</li>
