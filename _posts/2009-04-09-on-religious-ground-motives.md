<p>The Dutch philosopher, <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/dooyeweerd.htm">Herman Dooyeweerd</a>, makes the observation in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Roots of Western Culture</span>, that the underlying foundation of all of life is religious. Christianity, he notes, establishes an antithesis that "pertains to the relation between the creature and his creator, and thus touches the religious root of all temporal life."  His subsequent thoughts on this bring to light the profound tension that exists between our faith and this world, between belief and unbelief.  Dooyeweerd says,</p>
<blockquote>
The religious antithesis does not allow a higher synthesis.  It does not, for example, permit Christian and non-Christian starting points to be theoretically synthesized.  Where can one find in theory a higher point that might embrace two religious, antithetically opposed stances, when precisely because these stances are religious they rise above the sphere of the relative?  Can one find such a point in philosophy?  Philosophy is theoretical, and in its constitution it remains bound to the relativity of all human thought.  As such, philosophy itself needs an absolute point of departure.  It derives this exclusively from religion.  Religion grants stability and anchorage even to theoretical thought.  Those who think they find an absolute starting point in theoretical thought itself come to this belief through an essentially religious drive, but because of a lack of true self-knowledge they remain oblivious to their own religious motivation.<br /><br />

The absolute has a right to exist in religion only.  Accordingly, a truly religious starting point either claims absoluteness of abolishes itself.  It is never merely theoretical, for theory is always relative.  The religious starting point penetrates behind theory to the sure, absolute ground of all temporal, and therefore relative, existence.  Likewise, the antithesis it poses is absolute.
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, says Dooyeweerd,</p>

<blockquote>
to arrive at the true and decisive meaning of this antithesis and, at the same time, to penetrate to the real source of the differences of opinion concerning its significance, it is necessary to take into account the <span style="font-style: italic;">religious ground motives </span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">religieuze grondmotieven</span>) of Western civilization.  They have been the deepest driving forces behind the entire cultural and spiritual development of the West.<br /><br />

One can point to such a ground motive in every religion.  It is a spiritual force that acts as the absolutely central mainspring of human society.  It governs all of life's temporal expressions from the religious centre of life, directing them to the true or supposed origin of existence.  It thus not only places an indelible stamp on the culture, science, and social structure of a given period but determines profoundly one's whole world view.  If one cannot point to this kind of leading cultural power in society, a power that lends a clear direction to historical development, then a real crisis looms at the foundations of culture.  Such a crisis is always accompanied by spiritual uprootedness.<br /><br />

A spirit is directly operative in the religious ground motive.  It is either the spirit of God or that of an idol.  Man looks to it for the origin and unshakable ground of his existence, and he places himself in its service.  He does not control the spirit, but the spirit controls him.  Therefore specifically religion reveals to us our complete dependence upon a higher power.  We confront this power as servants, not as rulers.

I have long disliked the way in which the word <span style="font-style: italic;">religion</span> is thrown around and trampled on.  What is worse, I think, is the way evangelicals have grabbed onto this culture's use of the word and adopted for itself the false distinction between Christianity and religion.  Dooyeweerd here begins to offer a helpful corrective to the lines of demarcation we have unwittingly drawn.
