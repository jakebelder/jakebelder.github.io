[Article XI](http://www.thirtyninearticles.org/religion/#XI._Of_the_Justification_of_Man.) of the 39 Articles, ‘Of the Justification of Man’, opens with the line, ‘We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings.’ In his book, *[On the Thirty-Nine Articles: Conversations with Tudor Christianity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HITR40/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B005HITR40&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, [Oliver O’Donovan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_O%27Donovan) makes the observation that the choice of the phrase ‘accounted righteous before God’ is an important one. He remarks,

<blockquote>
There is a matter of importance wrapped up in that metaphor of ‘accounting’, a metaphor which, after all, is used in this connexion by Saint Paul. It defends the finality of God’s decision in the resurrection of Christ. God having raised up the righteous representative and set him on his right hand, what remains for him to do? Shall we say that he has many further tasks ahead of him, the making of numerous believers righteous? Shall we say that with only <em>one</em> man yet exalted to the throne of God, the redeeming work is hardly begun? Shall we say that with the Second Person home and dry, the Third Person has still to run his race? No, we may say none of these things. We must say that all is finished and complete. The sanctification of the many can do no more than realize the implications of what has already been accomplished. The coming of the Spirit to struggle with the flesh is simply a communication of the triumph that is won for all time… What God does for the individual believer, then, is not a new and different work, a further ‘making righteous’, but an application of the one complete work, a ‘counting’ of this believer into the righteous Kingdom already established and in place. In saying that we are <em>counted</em> righteous, the Reformers did not challenge the link between salvation and wholeness; they challenged the restriction of salvation to the sphere of the individual soul. We cannot comprehend justification in terms of what God does for each soul; for what transpires within that private sphere is but the expression of a public work upon the widest cosmic front already achieved: the redemption of the human race (78-79).
</blockquote>

This is an interesting emphasis. I suspect that when most people think of their justification, they think of it as an actual, separate work God does within them. But I think I like O'Donovan's emphasis here, that being justified is the *application* of a one-time and once-for-all work. That being said, I recognise that there is a sense in which, even if we accept O'Donovan's point, we can still speak of being *made* righteous as the benefits of Christ are applied to us. The application of Christ's finished work still effects an objective change within us.

As an aside, I'm sure you'll agree that discussing and thinking about these kinds of nuances and emphases are what make theology so much fun.
