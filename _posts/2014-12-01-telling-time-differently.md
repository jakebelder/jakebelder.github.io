[The video above provides a really helpful introduction to the Church calendar](https://vimeo.com/79923336) and the significance of the different seasons throughout the year. Although I didn't grow up in a context where the Church year was observed (with the exception of the major feast days), it is something I have come to deeply appreciate, and I think following the liturgical calendar is of great benefit to the shaping of the life of the Church, for a few different reasons.

In the first place, as the video says, it roots the Church in the story of the gospel. It's not just that we hear the gospel each time we meet together, though that should certainly be the case, but that we inhabit the story throughout the whole of the year in a much more profound way. We spend long periods of time reflecting and dwelling on the story of redemption and the work of Jesus to reconcile us to God and give us new life, situating ourselves within the unfolding drama. We slow down and recognise what God's people have known for so long â€“ that this is a story that unfolds over thousands and thousands of years, and that we have to wait upon the Lord, who brings salvation in the fullness of time.

This season of Advent that we have just entered into, for example, is so important for the Church because we have largely lost that sense of waiting and expectancy. Advent forces us to confront the reality that we continue to find ourselves living in a time of darkness, in a world that is still broken and in need of redemption. Slowing down to reflect on that helps us to enter into the longing and expectant waiting that the prophets spoke of as they waited for the promised Messiah, to join in Isaiah's cry: 'Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down!' (Isaiah 64:1). We can't jump right to Christmas; the coming of the Messiah only makes sense in the context of that longing for deliverance, as we learn what it means to expectantly hope in the fulfilment of God's promises. What's more, one of the characteristics of the Early Church was the sense that Jesus' return was imminent, and therefore the idea of running the race and pressing on in the pursuit of holiness was an urgent task, as was the call to make disciples of all nations and bear witness to Kingdom. As we wait for Christ's second Advent, recapturing this sense of the imminence of his return helps to reawaken a Church that in many ways has lost this urgency.

Secondly, this is about formation. As [James K.A. Smith](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) has observed, [we are shaped less by what we think than by what we love](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/james-k.a.-smith-on-the-formcontent-distinction-in-contemporary-worship), and those loves are cultivated by the stories and liturgies that we inhabit, intentionally or otherwise. He argues in his book, *[Desiring the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035775/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035775&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, that our culture is well aware of the reality that we are liturgical beings and bombards us ceaselessly with narrations of the world that seek to capture our hearts and imaginations and orient us towards a particular vision of flourishing and of what it means to be human. The only antidote to these pervasive attempts to re-narrate the world is to firmly root ourselves in the *true* story of the world, revealed to us in Scripture. [And the primary means we do this is through the worship of the Church](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/we-need-an-aversion-to-our-aversion-to-repetition-in-worship). The Church's calendar helps us to rehearse that true story of the world throughout the whole of the year in our worship, constantly keeping us rooted in that story and helping us resist those attempts to reshape and reorient us.

Finally, this is a way for Christians to be distinctly separate from the world, to declare that we belong to a different Kingdom and that our lives are ordered differently. Christ is Lord over all of our life, including how we mark time. We march to the ticking of a different clock, and allow that clock to set our focus and our priorities. As people who are baptised into Christ and given a new identity, we root ourselves in the story of redemption and spend the year pointing to Jesus and the salvation that comes through him, constantly rehearsing how God has acted in history and placing ourselves in that story.

And that can only be a good thing.
