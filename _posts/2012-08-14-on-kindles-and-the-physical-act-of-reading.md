<p>I bought a Kindle a couple of years ago. And I really do like it. But I just cannot bring myself to start buying all my books in Kindle format. In fact, I have hardly bought any, except for a few that were significantly marked down. Most of the content on my Kindle is stuff that Amazon has offered for free, such as classic works of literature, or it is PDF material and old material now copyright-free that people have formatted into e-book versions (such as the Church Fathers, some Puritan works, and so on, most of which I have found <a href="http://www.bringthebooks.org/search/label/Free%20Kindle%20Book" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Every time I see a new book I want to buy, I think for a minute about buying the proper Kindle version from Amazon, but I never do. And there are a few reasons that keep me from taking that step.</p>
<p>In the first place, I know I will feel like I am not getting my money's worth. I think it has something to do with not being able to hold and touch the book. I need that tangible reminder that I have purchased something. Talking to a friend about this once, he asked me, 'But what about music?' Well, that is true, I do buy music digitally. But listening to music from a CD or an iPod is, in essence, the same experience. It's about hearing the sound. In both cases, I simply press 'play' and sit back to take in the sound. Reading a book, however, involves a physical experience beyond just reading the words. I find the process easier, more enjoyable, and more satisfying when I am holding the bound pages that I have purchased.</p>
<p>Were the price of Kindle books less, I might be more inclined to buy them. But if a print book is &pound;9.61, and the Kindle version is going for &pound;6.85, I am probably going to spend the extra &pound;3 to get the print version. But what's more, I know that within a few months, used versions will start appearing at the same cost as the Kindle version (which cannot sell used copies, and does not go down in price). In fact, I rarely buy new books anymore, but have found some great sellers here in the UK which almost always carry used copies of the books I want for quite a bit less than new and always in great condition.</p>
<p>Second, while the Kindle does have the ability to highlight text and make notes, there is something about taking my 0.7mm pencil to the page of a book, underlining phrases and making notes in the margin. That is part of the experience of reading that I do not want to let go of. I remember much more of what I am reading from that process than I do from just clicking to highlight a bit of text on the Kindle. As a result of that physical, interactive reading process, when I go back to the print book to look for something, I always have a bit of a visual reminder etched in my mind &ndash; I can recall something of a mental picture reminding me where on a page a certain paragraph was that I want to reference.</p>
<p>Third, if my Kindle breaks, I am bound to buy another handheld device that will enable me to read Kindle books (I know I could use the computer, but no one wants to read books on the computer). All that is required to read my print books are my hands, to hold it open, and my eyes, to read the words.</p>
<p>Fourth &ndash; and this is just a personal preference &ndash; I like the look of bookshelves full of books. There is something warm and inviting about a room with full bookshelves, and I do not want to give that up. I also like being able to wander into a room, have a book on the shelf catch my eye, and take it down to start paging through it.</p>

In the end, the print book still wins out for me. It is all about the physical act of reading. I am sure e-book fans think I am making too big a deal of this, but the act of reading involves so much more than just reading the words, and I am not ready or willing to give that up.
