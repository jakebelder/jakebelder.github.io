<p>Rob Moll wrote an article for <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/">Christianity Today</a> last year called "<a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/december/10.24.html?start=1">Scrooge Lives!</a>", a rightly judgmental and provocative piece demonstrating that Christians don't just hold on tight to their purse strings&mdash;they lock them away in impenetrable safes. Because of this, the Church's mission is seriously hindered.</p>
<p>That American Christians don't give is nothing new, but some of the statistics he presented were staggering and downright depressing. Be sure to read the article for yourself. Below, I've posted some of the most mind-blowing figures.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>American Christians&mdash;[defined as] those who say their faith is very important to them and those who attend church at least twice a month&mdash;earn more than <span style="font-weight: bold;">$2.5 trillion dollars</span> every year.</li>
<li>If these Christians gave away 10 percent of their after-tax earnings, they would add another <span style="font-weight: bold;">$46 billion</span> to ministry around the world.</li>
<li>American Christians could realistically increase their giving by <span style="font-weight: bold;">$85.5 billion</span> each year.</li>
<li>The median annual giving for an American Christian is actually <span style="font-weight: bold;">$200</span>, just over half a percent of after-tax income.</li>
<li>In absolute terms, the poorest Christians give away more dollars than all but the wealthiest Christians.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$10 billion</span> would sponsor 20 million children for a year, and just <span style="font-weight: bold;">$330 million</span> would sponsor 150,000 indigenous missionaries in countries closed to religious workers. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$2.2 billion</span> would triple the current funding of Bible translation, printing, and distribution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">$600 million</span> would be enough to start eight Christian colleges in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, dear Christian who just spent $80,000 on a new Cadillac Escalade (justifying your purchase by sticking a Jesus fish to the back door so that you can "witness" as you drive around), did you know that that same $80,000 would put 36 indigenous missionaries in countries closed to religious workers? Should we even mention what could have been done with the money spent on that 5,000 sq. ft. house in the suburbs? Of course, Paul said not to muzzle our individual rights (1 Cor. 9:3-12)...didn't he? And that it doesn't matter what we give so long as our conscience is satisfied (2 Cor. 9:6-15)? What about James, who said we should look after ourselves (James 1:27)? Or Jesus, who said we can carry on as before and follow him (Matt. 16:24-28)?</p>

<p>The Reformer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">Martin Luther</a>, said, "There are three conversions necessary&mdash;the conversion of the heart, of the mind, and of the purse." It seems that last one might just be the hardest.</p>

Let's take a cue from <a href="http://counterfeitgods.com/">Tim Keller</a> and be honest here. We're talking about nothing less than idolatry.
