Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

As you can see, the past couple of weeks have been either been very slow, or – and this is much more likely – I have been very out of the loop.

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 231px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Bono-Ted.jpg"></div>

Here are the links from the week of <strong>29 June-12 July 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1pSM0DI">Should we preach like a TED talk?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Greenfarmhouse">Chris Green</a> has an interesting post on what preachers can learn from the <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> method, as well as some things they ought to avoid. The timing of this post was perfect, as I had just linked to something else about the TED method <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/miscellanees-week-26-2014">a couple weeks ago</a> and was thinking about what preachers could learn from this.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1kcaLHm">Why disagreement is not good</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/MartinBDavie">Martin Davie</a> has a thoughtful post here on Justin Welby's idea of 'good disagreement'. He largely disagrees with Welby's approach, and makes the case that instead the Church ought to be a community that pursues truth, and that aims at coming to agreement in the truth. (I would note as well that if Davie's reading of Welby is correct, the former is <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/why-anglicanism-makes-room-for-theological-exploration">arguably more Anglican</a> than the latter!)</li>
