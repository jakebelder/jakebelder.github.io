<p><a href="http://www.profrah.com">Soong-Chan Rah</a> is a professor at North Park Seminary in Chicago. He's recently written a book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0830833609?tag=sailor-moon-cosplay-20">The Next Evangelicalism: Freeing the Church from Western Cultural Captivity</a></em>. This video touches on the themes of his book, as he discusses American evangelicalism and the way it has become captive to the culture around it. There is lots of good stuff in here, and instead of trying to summarise it all, I'd encourage you to watch the video. If you've read Andy Crouch's excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Making-Recovering-Creative-Calling/dp/0830833943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274473569&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Culture Making</em></a>, you'll hear some similar things from Rah. Likewise, if you've read Jamie Smith's also excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desiring-Kingdom-Worldview-Formation-Liturgies/dp/0801035775/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274473599&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Desiring the Kindgom</em></a>, you'll appreciate a lot of what Rah has to say as well, particularly his reference to the mall as the centre of American religion. Additionally, Rah's emphasis on the need for the church to recognise the changing demographic's of America is important to understand.</p>
