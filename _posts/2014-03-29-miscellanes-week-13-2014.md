Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>23-29 March 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hdYqQB">A Reformation Timeline</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebishopuk">Steve Bishop</a> posts a timeline of the Reformation that he found in a recent book he read. Thankfully, it doesn't begin in 1517, although it still does begin with Luther!</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lfM7Ks">Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are</a></strong> – Here is a thoughtful piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould</a> on the whole question of sexual orientation. With so much damage caused by things like reparative therapy, he encourages people to go ahead and accept their orientation. This isn't what needs to change. For Christians to be faithful in the area of sexuality, the question is not about orientation, but about practice.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1l0zoc4">Dostoevsky the Liberal</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> observes that Dostoevsky, through the character of Ivan Karamazov, attempted to make the strongest case against Jesus he could. Leithart notes, though, that Dostoevsky can't solve the problem he poses because his Jesus is a liberal Jesus who offers no hope.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gxBVer">God Become Man: Towards a Richer Theology of the Incarnation</a></strong> – This is a good post on why the idea of 'incarnational theology/ministry' can take our eyes off the wonder and the significance of the incarnation of Jesus.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1j1TPoU">8 Reasons to Be Anglican</a></strong> – Here is a good summary of what is at the heart of Anglicanism. I resonate deeply with this, and it largely sums up why I am an Anglican.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jJuy17">Talking about worship</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PastorSteveJeff">Steve Jeffrey</a> notes the tendency in some evangelical circles to refuse to speak of 'Sunday worship' or the 'Sunday service', preferring to speak instead of a 'gathering'. He points out that there is really no warrant to do so.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gIeZck">How to Memorize Entire Books of the Bible</a></strong> – Memorising Scripture is a beneficial practice for all Christians, and certainly something God's people have done all throughout history. Memorising entire books may seem to be quite a challenge, but the method recommended here is really quite simple. It just takes commitment.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lreup8">Listening to Stories</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould</a> says that those of us seeking to help others be faithful to the biblical paradigm of sexuality need to begin to put our money where our theology is and actively reach out to help people. And that begins with listening to the stories of those who struggle with these things.</li>
