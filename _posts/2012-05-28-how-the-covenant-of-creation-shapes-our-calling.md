<p>A few weeks ago while on holiday, I had the opportunity to read O. Palmer Robertson's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0875524184/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0875524184"><em>The Christ of the Covenants</em></a>.  The book is something of a legend in the Reformed world, a tradition  which sees great significance in the covenant theme in Scripture. Not  having read it before, I thought the week off would prove a good time to  do so.</p>

<p>While the book as a whole is valuable, Robertson's chapter on the covenant of creation is particularly important. <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html">As I've written elsewhere</a>,  we have a tendency to devalue the covenant of creation, which in turn  leads us to neglect the role God gives to humanity on this earth. Instead of recognising that the covenant of creation shapes the whole of man's life in relation to God, some view this relationship as only encompassing the prohibition God sets in place  with respect to the tree in the garden because it is key in ushering in the subsequent covenant of redemption.</p>
<p>Robertson rightly demonstrates that this perspective effectively  ignores the whole of man's responsibilities under the covenant of  creation, and instead</p>
<blockquote>
an  extremely dangerous dualism will develop between man's 'religious' or  'spiritual' responsibilities and his 'cultural' or 'work-a-day'  responsibilities. Adam under the covenant of creation did not have one  set of duties relating to the created world, and another more specific  duty of an entirely different nature which could be designated as  'spiritual' (81-82).
</blockquote>
<p>How we understand the covenant of creation has all to do with how we  understand the gospel and the Kingdom of God. Failing to fully  understand the implications of the covenant of creation often results in  limiting the transforming power of the gospel and the rule of Christ to  the spiritual dimension of life. For Robertson, however, the covenant  relationship is a "total-life relationship," one in which God expects  humanity to submit the whole of their lives to his rule.</p>
<blockquote>
Too often  [Christians] may fail to consider adequately the effect of redemption on  the total life-style of man in the context of an all-embracive  covenant. That view results frequently in a by-passing of the  responsibility of redeemed man to carry forward the implications of his  salvation into the world of economics, politics, business, and culture  (82-83).
</blockquote>
<p>The covenant of creation originally called Adam to exercise authority  over all of creation as God's co-regent. That mandate has not ceased or  been overturned. Our continuing call as God's people is to bear witness  to his sovereign rule over the totality of creation. The fall into sin  adds a different element to our task in that we now need to carry out  our work in the context of a creation distorted by sin. But the  redemptive work of Christ ensures the redemption of the whole of  creation and enables us to continue fulfilling the cultural mandate and  already now to work towards freeing creation from the corrosive effects  of sin.</p>

In this way we faithfully carry out the role assigned to us in the  covenant of creation and honour the sovereign King who so graciously  brought us into relationship with himself.
