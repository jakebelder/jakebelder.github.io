<p>I found this word cloud online yesterday, and on the back of Wednesday's <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-genius-of-the-heidelberg-catechism" target="_blank">post on the Heidelberg Catechism</a>, thought it was worth sharing.</p>

<p>Considering what Philip Schaff said in the paragraph I quoted in the previous post about the Catechism so clearly presenting the gospel, it's no surprise which words in the cloud really stand out. Notice as well the Trinitarian emphasis &ndash; 'God', 'Christ', and 'Spirit' appear very prominently.</p>

Any other observations?
