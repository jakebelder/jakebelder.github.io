I am working my way through a biography of Karol Wotyla (apologies: I cannot seem to get Polish accents to appear), whom most will better know as Pope John Paul II. I find a lot of his thought and perspective to be captivating, and I'll have much more to say about that later. Recently I read a bit about his early perspectives on marriage, which he worked out in a play he wrote, entitled Our God's Brother, while he was a young priest in Krak√≥w, Poland. I am not yet married, but there are 373 days remaining until I am. This thought of Wotyla's struck me as something I must remember as I get closer to being married:

<blockquote>
Focusing so intently [in the play] on self-giving love as the foundation of the unbreakable bond of marriage, Wotyla was also making a large theological claim--that marriage is the beginning of our understanding of the interior life of God, the Trinity of self-giving persons in which personhood is fulfilled in the absolute gift of self. Marriage, he suggests, is the human experience that begins to make God comprehensible to human beings...the self-giving love and life-giving generativity of marriage are an icon for Wotyla of the interior life of the trinitarian God, and of God's interface witht he world through the Incarnation of his son (George Weigel, Witness to Hope, 116).
</blockquote>

I found this thought to be very deep. I knew that the love between a man and a woman in marriage was supposed to reflect the love of God manifested in the giving of Jesus, but I never thought that it could be seen as beginning to get a grasp on the nature of God. But I appreciate that thought very much. Not only does it give an idea of how great the love of God is and how great our love must be for one another, it also illustrates the depth of committment that marriage involves.

Of a love that is giving in nature, Wotyla also says, "Love is not 'fulfilling' oneself through the use of another. Love is giving oneself to another, for the good of the other, and receiving the other as a gift" (This idea is one of the five themes that Wotyla devised for the Srodowisko youth retreat in 1954).
