Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 256px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/sticks.JPG"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>02-08 March 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jLwBTl">God Save the King!</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould</a> tries to imagine what the Church of England might be like in twenty years. This is very interesting.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/NlX52E">How to speak and write postmodern</a></strong> – If you've ever wanted a tutorial in this kind of thing, here you go. This is brilliant. And, as one of my Twitter connections noted, it can equally be applied to theological liberals.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/MP8tTXKzObc">The Gilbert & Sullivan Mass</a></strong> – More quality stuff from <a href="http://twitter.com/LutheranSatire">Lutheran Satire</a>, which points to the fact that so much of what we attempt to do to keep young people in the church actually drives them away. The most effective way to raise your children as Christians really just involves doing a few simple things.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1f0uTZ6">Sabbath Sticks, OT Morality, and the Jesus Tea Strainer</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> has some helpful thoughts on Numbers 15:32-36, a tricky Old Testament text, and why we can never read these passages only through our modern lenses. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gR4Vtv">50 People in the Bible Confirmed Archaeologically</a></strong> – I don't have much to say about this except that it is quite an interesting list.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1fGPp73">Obsessed with Sex?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> says that Christians are (rightly) obsessed with sex, but only because we are deeply concerned for the good of society. He writes, "Sexual behavior and sexual norms are a key barometer of social health. If things are disordered in our bedrooms, they will be disordered in boardrooms and cabinet offices."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1drvjva">Can Evangelicals See Themselves in the LGBT Movement?</a></strong> – Here is a very interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> on the similarities between how evangelicalism and the LGBT movement understand identity, and the overlap in the way each try to define themselves. Alastair notes that this makes it difficult for evangelicals to effectively respond to challenges like the same-sex marriage debate.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gXrzRg">Wearing a Collar?</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1gXrBsg">Let's Talk Vestments</a></strong> –  There are two interesting posts here on the <a href="http://twitter.com/Anglican_Pastor">Anglican Pastor</a> blog on the significance of the clergy collar and of wearing vestments. I particularly like the idea that these things function to "de-emphasise individuality" and thus help to create an environment in which other expressions of individuality are welcome.</li>
