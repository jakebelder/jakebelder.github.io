<p>I am a big fan of getting together with a bunch of theologically-minded guys and spending a few hours together now and then talking about what we have been reading, working through issues that come up in our ministry, or mulling over big questions we have been asking and wrestling with. The preferred setting for this is a pub or coffeeshop, although I'm also perfectly happy to do so while working under the hood of a car, or walking down a city street, or sitting in my living room.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott">John Stott</a> wished for this sort of thing as well, as a means for ministers to keep their minds sharp and to build each other up. He writes of this being a good practice with a proven historical track record in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Worlds-Challenge-Preaching/dp/0802806279/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279668685&amp;sr=8-4"><em>Between Two Worlds</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I often find myself wishing that local clergy gatherings, whether denominational or interdenominational, could be more effective in stimulating thought. When we meet, we are no doubt obliged to transact some business, but we could also encourage one another in study. The second half of the eighteenth century was the great time for the founding of societies for English clergy, especially evangelicals. The first was Samuel Walker's 'Clerical Club' in Truro (c. 1750), whose purpose was to 'strengthen each other's hands in the work of the Lord'. During the following years about ten others arose in different parts of the country. 'Why may we not meet to pray, when others meet to play at the bowls?' asked Thomas Robinson of Leicester. 'Why may we not have deliberative assemblies, when others of our brethren have their dancing and drinking assemblies? Why may we not seek to edify each other, whilst they care not if they corrupt one another?' The most famous and influential of these clubs was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclectic_Society_%28Christian%29">Eclectic Society</a>, founded in 1783 by John Newton, ex-sea captain and slave trader, but at that time Rector of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_Woolnoth">St Mary Woolnoth</a> in the city of London, and his friends. They met every other Monday. 'We begin with tea,' wrote Newton (the teapot is preserved in the Church Missionary House in London); 'then a short prayer introduces a conversation for about three hours upon a proposed subject, and we seldom flag.' He added that the group deserved to be called the Royal Society since 'I trust the members are all of the royal family, and the King Himself condescends to meet with us.' (190)

<p>Not mentioned in Stott's list is the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Horse_Tavern,_Cambridge">White Horse Inn</a>' of Cambridge, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">Martin Luther's</a> frequent practice of having students over to his home for dinner and home-brewed beer to talk about all kinds of different issues; undoubtedly there are many more groups like these. This sort of thing is, I think, a very healthy practice and worth engaging in on a regular basis. Blogging, of course, is one outlet for me to work through all kinds of things I read and think about and questions I am working through, but I would never substitute it entirely for face-to-face conversation with friends, colleagues and mentors. That kind of interaction is invaluable.</p>

So, who'd like to go get a drink or a cup of coffee?
