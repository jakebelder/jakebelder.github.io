<p><a href="http://www.wscal.edu/clark/index.php">R. Scott Clark</a>, a professor at Westminster Seminary in California, wrote a book recently called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Reformed-Confession-Scott-Clark/dp/1596381108"><em>Recovering the Reformed Confession: Our Theology, Piety, and Practice</em></a>. The premise of the book is that the Reformed community is losing or has lost its sense of identity, and that it needs to recover it. Clark writes, "Much of what passes as Reformed among our churches is not. Its sources, spirit, and methods are alien to Reformed theology, piety, and practice. There are significant segments within the Reformed communion that define 'Reformed' in ways that our forefathers would not understand" (4).</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=502">John Frame</a> posted a <a href="http://www.frame-poythress.org/frame_articles/2010Clark.htm">review of the book on his website</a>. Someone apparently told Frame that the book should instead be called, <em>Why John Frame is Wrong About Absolutely Everything</em>. While that is humorous, it recognizes that there is a tension between Clark's and Frame's ideas of being Reformed, and that Clark is, in part, taking Frame to task in the book. If you're going to read the review, be sure to sit back in a comfortable chair&mdash;it is very long.</p>
<p>I haven't read Clark's book, and I won't if his writing in the book is anything like his <a href="http://heidelblog.wordpress.com">blog</a> (which I've had to stop reading because I have to keep my blood pressure under control). The problem with guys like Clark is that while they sometimes raise good questions&mdash;and I think the points in his book are largely worth discussing&mdash;they do it without humility and grace. Frame has taken to calling contentious voices like this the "Reformed Controversialists," and for good reason. More time seems to be spent on tearing others down than on constructively working through the issues at hand. It is unfortunate, because they could bring a lot of good questions to the table, and their voices could contribute a lot more to the building up of the Church.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4, Paul talks about the need to speak the truth in love to preserve the unity of the body of Christ. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/frame-interacting-with-the-thought-of-others">As I've mentioned before</a>, there is a reason that they honoured Frame by titling his festschrift with those words. All of us who have been privileged and blessed to study under him will tell you that there are few men who are willing to interact with those they disagree with as lovingly and graciously as Frame does. He has been a wonderful role model for us and for the Church. Jude 3 says that we must "contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints," something Frame devotes himself to. And he does it recognizing that, like Paul in 1 Corinthians 13, if he has not love, he has nothing.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that our traditions are important, and that we cannot live in a historical vacuum, ignorant of where we came from and who we are. These are good things to talk about, and I think Clark is right to raise questions about our Reformed identity. But resorting to a sort of hostile polemic to argue a case and misrepresenting those who hold views you don't agree with is not helpful; indeed, it's harmful and destructive to the Church (again I must acknowledged that I haven't read the book, but have spent quite a lot of time reading Clark's blog). Maybe this is the reason large segments of the Reformed community don't want to be identified with that small (albeit disproportionately vocal) segment of the Reformed community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.frame-poythress.org/frame_articles/2010Clark.htm">Read Frame's review</a> if you want his take on the nuances of Clark's argument. All I want to emphasize is that when we interact with others who don't share our perspectives, we must do it with love and charity. We do so because of our love for God, because of our love for our neighbour, and because of our love for the Church. Granted, this is a lot harder than just lobbing grenades at your opponents. But it is required of us, and doesn't leave a trail of destruction in our wake; instead, it leaves a Church that is strengthened, edified, and brought closer to the unity Christ calls us to.</p>

By all means, raise questions, provoke thought, discuss issues. But do so in love.
