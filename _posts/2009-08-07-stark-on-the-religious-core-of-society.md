<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Stark">Werner Stark</a> was an Austrian sociologist who taught for some time at <a href="http://www.fordham.edu">Fordham University</a> in New York City.  Upon the recommendation of a professor, I picked up the first volume of his five-volume, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Sociology-of-Religion/Werner-Stark/e/9780415175883"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Sociology of Religion: A Study of Christendom</span></a>, which deals with the sociology of established religion throughout history.

Stark's basic thesis is that religion, contrary to the the secondary status many want to ascribe to it today, continues to be central to the identity and orientation of a society.  From his introduction:

<blockquote>
Since the end of the Middle Ages, Western man has made the conquest and control of the physical universe his leading value and his prime pursuit; on the other hand, earlier concerns, more metaphysical in nature, have been allowed to fade into the background.  This development has created the impression that religion&mdash;the metaphysical quest <span style="font-style: italic;">par excellence</span>&mdash;is a marginal rather than a central phenomenon in social life and consequently has only a minor claim on the attention of the sociologist.  But nothing could be more erroneous than such an idea.  What has happened in recent centuries is not that religion has decayed and largely disappeared and a kind of all-enveloping positivism and rationalism has taken its place; it is merely that new forms of belief have arisen and taken their place alongside older ones.
</blockquote>

In this instance Stark, writing in the late 1960s, goes on to speak of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousseau">Rousseau</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx">Marx</a> as examples of these new forms of belief, and I think we'd have little trouble identifying the forms of belief that shape our society and culture today.  Stark recognizes that there is something different in these new religious forms, and so qualifies the distinction between the two:

<blockquote>
Admittedly, there is a world of difference between belief in a personal and belief in a non-personal god; [those which deify a non-personal god] should therefore be called pseudo-religions rather than religions in the proper sense of the word.  But while the theological contrast between the creeds is very great, the distinction between their social consequences is small.  The ability to unite and divide, to inspire intensive love and at times also mortal hate, is hardly less marked in the new faiths than in the old.
</blockquote>

For almost all of human history, Stark notes, mankind has oriented his life around the belief in a personal deity, and so in that respect the religious developments of Western society in the last few hundred years are especially unique.  He is right to recognize, however, that even though the religious aspect of society is now made up of different forms of belief, there is still a fundamentally religious core that gives shape to every part of social reality.
