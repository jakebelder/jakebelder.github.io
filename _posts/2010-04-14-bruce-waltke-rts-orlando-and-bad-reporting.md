<p>I have a number of reasons for blogging. However, I have never intended this blog to be a place to air grievances, a means of exposing "heretics," or a forum to tear down brothers and sisters in the church. Sadly, this is what a lot of blogs are used for.</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 236px; height: 320px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/waltke.jpg" /></div>
<p>Last week, Bruce Waltke resigned from his position as professor of Old Testament studies at the Orlando campus of <a href="http://www.rts.edu/site/about/campuses/orlando/index.aspx">Reformed Theological Seminary</a>. It was quite clear from the outset that his sudden resignation was linked in some way to a video he had appeared in posted by the <a href="http://biologos.org/">Biologos Foundation</a>, in which he argued for the necessity of accepting theistic evolution, although there was no official statement released giving the details of Waltke's resignation.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, then, the blogosphere lit up as many took the opportunity to offer their opinions and speculations (disguised, of course, as factual statements) regarding what happened. Also of little surprise were the scathing remarks the vast majority of these bloggers had for RTS claiming that the seminary had forced Waltke to resign and criticising the school both for its limiting of academic freedom and for its adherence to a position regarding creation that science has proven to be untenable.</p>
<p>A lot of us around the campus spent time last week trying  to figure out exactly what had happened because we were not being given  many details. Having only received a very short email from the administration saying that Waltke had resigned, and nothing more, we were especially confused when the reports started coming out that RTS had forced  Waltke to step down. I expressed my desire  to some of the staff members at the seminary to see an official statement filling us in on the details. On the one hand, this would make us aware of what was going on, and on the other hand, could  prove the wide-ranging speculations being promulgated on the internet wrong, which they later did. You can find chancellor <a href="http://www.rts.edu/newsevents/newsdetails.aspx?news_id=1371">Ric Cannada's statement here</a>, and Uri Brito has also posted a <a href="http://apologus.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/bruce-waltke-and-theistic-evolution/">letter Waltke himself wrote</a> to his colleagues regarding the situation.</p>
<p>The best report available online right now is  provided by <em>The Aquila Report</em>, who the other day posted <a href="http://theaquilareport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1855:ot-professor-bruce-waltke-resigns-from-rts-orlando-faculty-amid-historical-adam-and-eve-controversy&amp;catid=51:ministries&amp;Itemid=134">this extensive and  helpful statement</a>. It was affirmed by some of the staff at RTS that this is  indeed the most balanced and fair treatment of the events that have  transpired in the past few weeks, and although there are some minor factual inaccuracies (the details surrounding the relationship of Enns and Waltke, I have been told, are somewhat inaccurate), it largely avoids the mud-slinging and finger-pointing that have characterised so many of the others "reports." To that end, I ask that you please read this report  instead of the incorrect and speculative posts you find on most blogs, including the unhelpful piece <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/04/09/video"><em>Inside Higher Education</em></a> recently posted</p>
<p>As with almost everything else, there is an ethic when it comes to publishing information, be it in a newspaper or magazine, or on a personal blog. Perhaps the power to click the "publish" button on the bottom of the screen overrides better judgment in some cases, but unfortunately there is no way to control who is publishing what online. One of our professors was remarking yesterday that actual investigative reporting is on the wane these days. Reporters now have their sources in various places and use the information they receive from these sources to make their reports. While these are often regulated as much as possible with the necessary checks and balances to ensure factual accuracy, this can hardly be said for the blogosphere. Using wisdom and abiding by an ethical standard becomes solely the responsibility of the blogger. More often than not, then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_corrupts#.22Lord_Acton.27s_dictum.22">Lord Acton's dictum </a>rings true: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>
<p>Being a student at RTS Orlando, this hit very close to home. I was deeply saddened to hear of Waltke's resignation. Not only have we lost one of&mdash;if not <em>the</em>&mdash;most preeminent Old Testament scholar alive today, but we have lost a man whose love for the Lord was without measure, whose love for the church was inspiring, and whose love of the Word of God was infectious. One example I can share that demonstrates his character comes from working in the bookstore at the seminary. A number of times, Waltke has purchased some of his own books and shipped them, at great cost to himself, to pastors in countries in the developing world who had little or not access to good theological resources.</p>
<p>I do not believe the issue surrounding Waltke's resignation warranted such drastic action. While I do not adhere to theistic evolution myself, Waltke was clear in his affirmation of God as creator and of the historicity of Adam and Eve. As such, I do not think he falls outside the bounds of orthodoxy. It has been said a few times in the past week (though as far as I know, it remains unverified) that even one of the stalwarts of Reformed theology, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._B._Warfield">B. B. Warfield</a>, was an adherent of theistic evolution.</p>

I never had the privilege of having Waltke as a professor, due to scheduling conflicts with my classes. But he has been an immense blessing to our community here at RTS, and to me particularly in his writing. Sad as we are to see him go, we wish him the Lord's richest blessings in whatever endeavour he undertakes next.
