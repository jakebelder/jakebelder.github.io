Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 269px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/censer.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>12-18 January 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ftUqk0">Reading Culture Charitably: A Reply to Eric Jacobsen</a></strong> – A while back, <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/contributors/ejacobsen/">Eric Jacobsen</a> had some <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/4114/the-ballet-of-street-life-on-common-grace-liturgies">really thoughtful engagement</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035775/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035775&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21"><em>Desiring the Kingdom</em></a>, on seeing the Spirit at work in the world around us. Smith here offers some further thoughts in his reply to Jacobsen, which makes for a very interesting conversation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cibwtp">Confessions of a Former Skeptic: Questions for Institutional Vocation in the Garden</a></strong> – This is an interesting piece by <a href="http://twitter.com/muddiedprayers">Chris Schoon</a>, pastor of <a href="http://firsthamilton.ca/">a church in my hometown</a>, who has come to appreciate and value institutions. He asks some key questions that help us think about what their role is in culture.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/L6Mh7H">Tales of the New Creation</a></strong> – I don't often speak this way, but this is just a beautiful and moving piece. The author talks about the fact that we live in a story, and that as part of that story, we are to be signposts pointing forward to the end of the story, the New Creation. And the hope we have that all things will be made new is the hope we must offer to a broken world. After reading this, I'm longing for creation's renewal more than ever.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cmu6QX">Adoption is About Transformation</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> quotes <a href="http://www.westernsem.edu/faculty/billings">J. Todd Billings</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._I._Packer">J.I. Packer</a> on how being adopted by God is not just a one-time event, but transforms our whole identity.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eInEJ4">Why Millennials Long for Liturgy</a></strong> – Articles of this sort are plentiful these days, each one pointing to a few people who are leaving evangelical churches for Roman Catholic or Orthodox churches, and thus claiming a growing trend. Make of it what you will – a few people here and there can hardly be considered a trend – but I do find it interesting that stuff like this keeps coming up.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ePNwCO">Are Millennials Joining High Church Traditions?</a></strong> – That being said, <a href="http://twitter.com/jake_meador">Jake Meador</a>, on the <a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/about/">Mere Orthodoxy blog</a>, helpfully responds to the above article. In particular he notes that for those people who are tired of evangelicalism, they don't need to look outside of Protestantism for something that is not historically ignorant or sacramentally impoverished.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aoeArd">Gerald Bray on Gafcon II and the future of the Anglican Communion</a></strong> – <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/geraldlbray">Bray</a> has some interesting thoughts here on the future of the <a href="http://gafcon.org/">GAFCON</a> movement, suggesting that it is something Anglicans around the world, and especially in the West, need to take seriously. He makes some trenchant remarks particularly on what <a href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/about-justin-welby.html">Justin Welby</a> must do in response.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ePMXsM">Archbishop Justin appoints Evangelical Tory Baucum to Canterbury</a></strong> – Now, this is very interesting. Welby has appointed a priest from the Anglican Church in North America as one of the six preachers at Canterbury Cathedral. This is not insignificant.</li>
