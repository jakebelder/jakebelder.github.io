Christian theology teaches that after our sin has been forgiven through the grace of God, there is a necessary response required of us on account of that. In the tradition I grew up in, this is generally required as a "duty". I don't like that.

The Bible study group I am involved in has been working through the epistle to the Philippians, and much of our discussion has been centered around what it means to have joy. For a long time I have not understood what joy was, much the same way that much of the church today does not understand. I lived dangling between the ideas of sin and grace riding a tumultuous roller coaster of faith. I could never get beyond that because I was always preoccupied with the extent of my sin, and my seeming inability to do anything about it. The problem was that I was not living for God, but myself. I have begun to get beyond this, but it is still a struggle.

Joy is not the absence of suffering or the abundance of wealth. Joy is being sure of the glorious bliss that awaits us. It is living with hope, knowing that what is here is temporal, knowing that Christ will return to redeem everything and to fulfill the covenant. Joy is living within and out of the promises that we have through faith. Here is where I have a problem with looking at our response to God for His gift of salvation as a duty. Yes, it is required of us, but to look at it as just that almost *de-personalizes* God. God is no longer seen as the God of love who had mercy on His people. Rather, He is the God who made a transaction with us in which we have an obligation to do something in return. Also, looking at our response as a duty allows no room for joy because we always fall short (Romans 3:23). That is sure cause for spiritual depression.

What if altered the perspective? What if our response to God is out of love *for Him*? God acted out of love for us, so how much more should we live out of love for Him! This should be a natural result of living with joy. While I think that living according to God's commands is necessary, maybe put that aside for a minute and think about living with this mindset: knowing what awaits you upon death and/or Christ's return, and being sure of your salvation because of His love for you. With this thought, it seems only natural that we should fall on our knees and cry, "I love you, Lord!" From there, all that we do should be driven by a love for God, joy, and a desire to glorify Him. The Christian life is not a duty, it is a joy.

With that in mind, I will go and try to live that way.
