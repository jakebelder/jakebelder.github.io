<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Nicolaas_Ridderbos">Herman Ridderbos</a>, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Kingdom-Herman-N-Ribberbos/dp/0875524087/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206649246&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Coming of the Kingdom</span></a>, discusses the present character of the kingdom of God and the Messianic work of bringing the "lost sheep" together in Christ, quoting Matthew 11:28, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are very laden, and I will give you rest," and then stating the following:</p>

<blockquote>
'Those that labor' and are 'laden' are troubled, not by their 'cares' or their 'sins,' but very particularly by the 'burden' of the Pharisaical prescriptions.  They are to be looked upon as 'sheep without a shepherd' in this particular sense.  It is not a timeless message of rest for their souls, but these words originate from the consciousness that the great turning-point of the times has come, and that the Divine redemption can be sought and found only in Christ.  In these words of the Savior God holds out his arms to his wandering people.  That is why here the kingdom is <span style="font-style: italic;">present</span>, notwithstanding all its mystery and its preliminary character.<br /><br />

Any attempt, therefore, to build up a doctrine of redemption which has not been based on the person and the work of Jesus as the Christ must be rejected.  On the ground of these sayings about the seeking of those who were lost there would then be merely the message of God's fatherly love which, however, would be in glaring conflict with the redemptive-historical character of the gospel.  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:3-7&amp;version=47;">That the lost sheep are sought</a>, that <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:11-32&amp;version=47;">the prodigal son can return</a>, that salvation is preached to publicans and sinners, is only true and possible because Jesus is the Christ, and in him the kingdom of God has come.  This is the great presupposition of Jesus' words as the Savior with respect to that which was lost.  If we detach these words from this presupposition we deprive the gospel of its basis.  No doubt this also implies that as the Christ Jesus is not only the coming judge of the world, the Son of Man upon the clouds of heaven.  But the Christological character of the entire gospel, including 'the gospel to sinners,' should be beyond dispute (155).

The centrality of Christ to our faith cannot be understated.  As Ridderbos declares, the gospel cannot stand without the person and work of Christ;  neither, consequently, can our faith.  This is why, with the apostle Paul, we must proclaim the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians%201:15-23&amp;version=31">supremacy of Christ</a> realizing that it is "through Christ [that] we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand" (Rom. 5:2).  For that reason we must bow the knee to the one who declares, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6).
