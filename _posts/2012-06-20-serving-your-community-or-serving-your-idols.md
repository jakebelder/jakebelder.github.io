<p>England's victory against Ukraine last night sent them through to the next stage of the <a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/" target="_blank">Euro 2012 tournament</a>, and they now face Italy on Sunday evening. I saw this tweet pop up in my feed after the match:</p>

<p>When I saw the tweet, my immediate thought was that this was a good (though potentially rather expensive!) idea. As I reflected on it more today, though, I found my thoughts changing a bit. While I still like the idea, I think it raises some questions.</p>
<p>First, what would it say about the local church that might opt to do this? The community would be appreciative of the free drinks, but would it really serve to generate relationships between the church and community? Possibly, although the last match I watched in a pub did not really provide any  good opportunities for conversation simply because of how many people  were crammed in and how loud the volume on the television was. I am all for pub ministry &ndash; I think it is a great environment in which to meet people and form relationships &ndash; but this coming Sunday evening would certainly not be the most effective time to do so. The fact that this is being suggested for Sunday is interesting too; I wonder how many churches thought to do this last night.</p>
<p>Second, and far more importantly, is this just a cleverly disguised excuse to serve an idol? Is it really a desire to be present in the community for the sake of the gospel, or are we just masking a deeper desire to worship the god of football? Are we saying that football is more important than encountering the living Christ in the preached Word and at his table, than being refreshed and encouraged and built up by meeting with God's people in order to prepare ourselves to face another week of serving him in the world?</p>
<p>The Bible, of course, does not give specific times that God's people must meet together on a Sunday, but it does tell us to "not give up meeting together" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:25&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:25</a>), and impresses upon us the importance of corporate worship for the nurturing of our faith. If your church has a service that will conflict with the match, what ought to take priority? (I speak hypocritically here &ndash; I have twice skipped church to attend the Daytona 500.) Every leader in the church at some point or another faces the challenge of trying to get all the members of the community of believers to understand the importance of gathering together. If allowance is suddenly made for the whole church to forego this for the sake of watching football, what does this communicate? If it is okay to skip church to watch football, what else is it okay to skip for?</p>
<p>Our service on Sunday evening begins at 6:30, so we could conceivably be done with the service and at the pub across the road before the match began. If this is the same story with your church, then go for it. But should a church cancel or move services just to watch football, even a game as exciting as this one? I'm not so sure. Perhaps this is one of those situations <a href="http://jakebelder.com/sometimes-faithfulness-hurts" target="_blank">where faithfulness might just hurt a little</a>.</p>

The more I thought about this, the more questions it raised (I don't think I have ever used so many question marks in one post). I am genuinely interested to know what all of you think of this, as I am still not entirely sure what I think. Please do leave a comment and contribute to this conversation.
