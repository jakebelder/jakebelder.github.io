<p>In my spare time&mdash;well, actually when I should doing schoolwork&mdash;I have been reading some on the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. Having known very little about the tradition, I wanted to get a better picture of its roots. It was only recently that I learned of the great influence some of the continental Reformers had on Anglicanism during its most formative time, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Martire_Vermigli">Peter Martyr Vermigli</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer">Martin Bucer</a>, who both spent many years there, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_calvin">John Calvin</a>, whose influence spread through his writings.<br /><br />The most notable Reformer in the English tradition is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>. Church history classes I have taken in the past have touched on his life and work, but my knowledge of him was rather limited. One of the books I have been reading is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Neill">Stephen Neill's</a> 1958 study, simply called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anglicanism-Stephen-Neill/dp/0195200330/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258252142&amp;sr=8-5"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anglicanism</span></a>. Early on, discussing Cranmer's influence in the English Reformation, he writes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
It is to be noted that Cranmer, like the other Reformers, had fallen in love with the Bible. But his love took a particular form. He believed that the Bible was the living word of God to every man, and that it comes with the greatest power when unaccompanied by any human gloss, comment, or exposition. He was convinced that, if his fellow countrymen could be induced to read the word of God, or, if illiterate, to hear it read, it would in course of time make its way into their hearts and consciences.
</blockquote>
<p>Neill writes that the composition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_common_prayer"><span style="font-style: italic;">Book of Common Prayer</span></a> was, without measure, the most significant contribution Cranmer made to the Church in the Reformation era. Whereas the genius of men like Calvin lay in their theological contributions, for Cranmer it was formulating a liturgy saturated with Scripture. Neill continues:</p>
<blockquote>
It was only in the next reign [of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England">Edward VI</a>] that Cranmer was able to provide his Church with a lectionary; when he was able to do so, he made the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England">Church of England </a>in a day the greatest Bible-reading Church in the world. In no other Church anywhere is the Bible read in public worship so regularly, with such order, and at such length, as in the Anglican fellowship of Churches. In making such provision, Cranmer was laying heavy demands on his Englishmen, and reposing great confidence in them. But in that too he was the typical Anglican&mdash;Anglicanism is a form of the Christian faith that demands and expects a great deal from ordinary people.</blockquote>
<p>In those churches which still use the <span style="font-style: italic;">Book of Common Prayer</span>, Cranmer's influence lives on. It is quite something to worship with an Anglican congregation and see how Scripture saturates the liturgy, and to know that this was the work of Cranmer himself. I find it quite significant that Neill sees the Anglican tradition defined by its worship, as opposed to a tradition like my own, which is characterized much more by its theology.</p>

And so Neill writes, "We have no English Luther or Calvin...[instead] we have as our chief reformer the man who had a greater genius for liturgical worship than any other of whom we have record in the whole history of the Church."
