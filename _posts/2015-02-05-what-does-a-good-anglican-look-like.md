This question has been at the heart of a module I have been taking over the past couple of terms, as a few of us have wrestled through the writings of Anglican theologians from the 16th century onwards, old parliamentary acts, and other significant historical documents. As of yet, we do not have an answer to the question – although there are still several weeks left in the term.

However, I stumbled across something last week that I remember initially seeing [on Peter Hitchens' blog a couple of years ago](http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2013/07/the-lost-past-of-the-church-of-england-an-archaeological-discovery-.html), which reminded me that being a good Anglican, while certainly encompassing questions about the nature of authority, the threefold order of ministry, theological method, and so on, is also, on the individual level, simply about being holy. That something is this fascinating list of the duties of church members issued by the Archbishops over sixty years ago:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Duties%20of%20members.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Duties%20of%20members.jpg" width="450" alt="Duties of Anglican church members"></a>

This list must have been published sometime between 1945 and 1955, as that is when [Geoffrey Fisher's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Fisher) and [Cyril Garbett's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Garbett) times as Archbishops of Canterbury and York, respectively, overlapped (it is interesting to note that the version Hitchens found in an old church dates from at least six years later). The language, of course, is from a different era, and I wonder if our Archbishops would be so quick to speak of the 'duties' of church members today.

That being said, in many ways, this should not feel old-fashioned. And that is because holiness ought to remain foundational to answering the question of what a good Anglican looks like because. As [Paul Avis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Avis) has noted in a number of his books, to be an Anglican is first and foremost to be a Christian: to be in communion with Christ and his people, conformed to his likeness, and sent out to bear witness to him – just the sorts of things the list of duties calls us to.

The point is simply that even if you have your ecclesiology sorted, your Eucharistic theology nailed down, and your understanding of the episcopate ironed out, without holiness, you can never be a good Anglican.
