Wright</a> on why he wrote, <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5528/nm/Surprised+by+Hope%3A+Rethinking+Heaven,+the+Resurrection,+and+the+Mission+of+the+Church+%28Hardcover%29?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners"><em>Surprised By Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
This book addresses two questions that have often been dealt with entirely separately but that, I passionately believe, belong tightly together. First, what is the ultimate Christian hope? Second, what hope is there for change, rescue, transformation, new possibilities within the world in the present? And the main answer can be put like this. As long as we see Christian hope in terms of 'going to heaven,' of a salvation that is essentially <em>away from</em> this world, the two questions are bound to appear unrelated. Indeed, some insist angrily that to ask the second one at all is to ignore the first one, which is the really important one. This in turn makes some others get angry when people talk of resurrection, as if this might draw attention away from the really important and pressing matters of contemporary social concern. But if the Christian hope is for <em>God's new creation</em>, for 'new heavens and new earth,' and if that hope has already come to life in Jesus of Nazareth, then there is every reason to join the two questions together. And if that is so, we find that answering the one is also answering the other. I find that to many &ndash; not least, many Christians &ndash; all this comes as a surprise: both that the Christian hope is surprisingly different from what they had assumed and that this same hope offers a coherent and energizing basis for work in today's world (5).

These are important questions, and already now I'm starting to think about the large-scale implications of how we understand the hope he is talking about. I am looking forward to finding out how he answers the questions in more detail.
