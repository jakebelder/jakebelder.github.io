Stories of people who have given up their Christian faith because of science are not uncommon. In his recent book, *[How (Not) to be Secular](http://amzn.to/1xWdxeo)*, [James K.A. Smith](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith), interacting with [Charles Taylor’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_%28philosopher%29) tome, *[A Secular Age](http://amzn.to/1xhsrZN)*, makes this observation about such people (page numbers in the paragraph reference Taylor’s book):

<blockquote>
If someone tells you that he or she has converted to unbelief because of science, don’t believe them. Because what’s usually captured the person is not scientific evidence per se, but the <em>form</em> of science: ‘Even where the conclusions of science seem to be doing the work of conversion, it is very often not the detailed findings so much as the form’ (p. 362). Indeed, ‘the appeal of scientific materialism is not so much the cogency of its detailed findings as that of the underlying epistemological stance, and that for ethical reasons. It is seen as the stance of maturity, of courage, of manliness, over against childish fears and sentimentality’ (p. 365). But you can understand how, on the retelling, the convert to unbelief will want to give the impression that it was the scientific evidence doing the work. Converts to unbelief always tell subtraction stories (76-77).
</blockquote>

Smith goes on to note that, not surprisingly, those who convert to unbelief usually had an immature faith to begin with, one without any real grounding and therefore easily toppled. And when they paint their conversion as a growth in maturity, this only ‘betrays the simplistic shape of the faith they’ve abandoned’ (77). But it is also important to note that this conversion is not simply about a quest for *knowledge*. It goes deeper than that. Smith continues:

<blockquote>
Such tales of maturity and ‘growing up’ to 'face reality’ are stories of courage – the courage to face the fact that the universe is without transcendent meaning, without eternal purpose, without supernatural significance. So the convert to unbelief has ‘grown up’ because she can handle the truth that our disenchanted world is a cold, hard place. At the same time, there can be something exhilarating in this loss of purpose and teleology, because if nothing matters, and we have the courage to face this, then we have a kind of Epicurean invulnerability. While such a universe might have nothing to offer us by way of comfort, it’s also true that ‘in such a universe, nothing is demanded of us’ (p. 367). Now the loss of purpose is also a liberation: ‘<em>we</em> decide what goals to pursue’. God is dead; <em>viva la revolution</em> (77-78).
</blockquote>

In the end, then, despite the narrative told by the convert of a noble quest for knowledge, this new-found belief in science is not entirely about growing up and being able to face reality, but is more an attempt to hide from the brokenness of this world and an excuse to live however you want.

However, with a framework devoid of all meaning and purpose, after the initial rush of 'exhilaration', the end result can only be misery. There is a better way, and that is to move beyond the immature faith these converts once held – not to give up on faith, but to seek a faith that fully and truly embraces the reality of Christ’s Lordship over all of life and all of creation. It is this Christ who has been victorious over sin and death and who now reigns as King who provides the only answer to the brokenness of this world, and who alone provides meaning and purpose. It is this Christ who offers to us life in all its fullness as we surrender ourselves to him, and die and rise to new life with him. And what's more, our lives are invested with new and profound meaning and purpose as we, in the power of his Spirit, are enabled to begin to actually *do* something about the brokenness of the world by seeking to bear witness to his redemption and his Lordship in everything we say and do.

That, of course, is a conversion story seldom heard in public. But it's far more exciting and life-transforming.
