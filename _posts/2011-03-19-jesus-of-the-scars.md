Edward Shillito was an English minister who lived from 1872-1948. During the first World War, he wrote this poem, 'Jesus of the Scars'.

<blockquote>
If we have never sought, we seek Thee now;<br>
Thine eyes burn through the dark, our only stars;<br>
We must have sight of thorn-pricks on Thy brow;<br>
We must have Thee, O Jesus of the Scars.<br><br>

The heavens frighten us; they are too calm;<br>
In all the universe we have no place.<br>
Our wounds are hurting us; where is the balm?<br>
Lord Jesus, by Thy Scars we claim Thy grace.<br><br>

If when the doors are shut, Thou drawest near,<br>
Only reveal those hands, that side of Thine;<br>
We know today what wounds are; have no fear;<br>
Show us Thy Scars; we know the countersign.<br><br>

The other gods were strong, but Thou wast weak;<br>
They rode, but Thou didst stumble to a throne;<br>
But to our wounds only Godâ€™s wounds can speak,<br>
And not a god has wounds, but Thou alone.
</blockquote>
