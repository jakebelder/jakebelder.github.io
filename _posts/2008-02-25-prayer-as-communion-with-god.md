[This](http://fatherstephen.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/the-warfare-of-prayer/) is an example of why I feel there is so much to learn from the perspectives of Orthodoxy.

<blockquote>
The purpose of prayer is nothing other than communion of God and man. Salvation itself is the restoration of this communion. The Christian life is to be a continual growth in communion with God. Thus our life of prayer is not an occasional intercession thrown out at the universe on behalf of some matter about which we have concern---but is rather a continual relationship in which we give ourselves to God and receive God again to ourselves.
