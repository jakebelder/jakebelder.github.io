One of the most unique and great things about being human is that we get names. We each have a different and individual name that identifies us. My full name is Jacob John Belder. These three names are forever connected with me as an individual. In the future, I hope my posterity and those who know me---maybe even read about me---will be able to connect my name with thinking of a person who served God wholeheartedly, was a man of integrity, and loved life and people. At least, this is my hope and prayer.

But my name also connects me with a family and an history. Jacob was my grandfather's name. John is my father's name. Belder is my family name that connects me to a much bigger group of people, most of who remain in the Netherlands, and who trace their history to a bunch of modest farmers. While it's not a family of people whom history considers "great", it is also nothing to be ashamed of. I carry the name with pride.

This past Sunday, I worshiped at the West Highland Baptist Church here in Hamilton. I believe the called it "Nametag Sunday". It was great, everyone was wearing the little stick-on nametags, identifying who we were. The purpose was for people to greet people they didn't know, and to do so by using their names. What an amazing idea! When you call someone by name, you create and instant connection with them because immediately they have an identity. They are not just another person. Further, being identified by a name is a very biblical notion; the most important part of who God is is that He has a name, he is I Am---Lord. His name identifies who He is, His name identifies His nature. In the Ancient Near East, people were given names infused with meaning. According to John Frame, "Usually, when a father gave a name to his son, he chose a name that didn't just sound good but conveyed something of his hopes for the child, or his feelings about the child, or the circumstances of the child's birth" (Salvation Belongs to the Lord, 5-6). Look at the meanings of Abraham, or Moses, or Jesus. We don't do that anymore today.

Make a point to call people by name, and make an honest effort to remember their name. Do them the honor of giving them an identity. It breaks down barriers, it creates bonds, it shows consideration, and it's just plain nice. Remember that as one of the defining characteristics of God is His name, so should this be how we remember His children.
