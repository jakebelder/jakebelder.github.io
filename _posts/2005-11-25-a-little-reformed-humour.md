Courtesy of Dr. James R. Payton, Jr.:

A former Baptist minister, reflecting on his switch over to a Presbyterian church, said, "I used to think that election meant God cast a vote for me, the devil cast a vote against me, and I cast the deciding vote. Then I realized that I wasn't old enough to vote, and the devil wasn't registered to vote."
