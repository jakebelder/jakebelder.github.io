I love what the [Heidelberg Catechism](http://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism) says about God being both sovereign creator and Lord, as well as our Father, as it unpacks the first part of the [Apostles' Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed) in Q&A 26:

<blockquote>
<strong>Q. What do you believe when you say,<br>
'I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br>
creator of heaven and earth'?<br><br></strong>

A. That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
who out of nothing created heaven and earth<br>
and everything in them,<br>
who still upholds and rules them<br>
by his eternal counsel and providence,<br>
is my God and Father<br>
because of Christ his Son.<br><br>

I trust him so much that I do not doubt<br>
he will provide<br>
whatever I need<br>
for body and soul,<br>
and he will turn to my good<br>
whatever adversity he sends me<br>
in this sad world.<br><br>

He is able to do this because he is almighty God;<br>
he desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.
</blockquote>

And I certainly wish I could echo those words – 'I trust him so much that I do not doubt...' – with that kind of confidence much more often.
