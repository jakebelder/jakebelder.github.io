<p><a href="http://jakebelder.com/miscellanees-weeks-28-29-2012" target="_blank">On Saturday</a>, I mentioned Alastair Roberts' <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/triggering-and-triggered-1/" target="_blank">first helpful post</a> on issues and responses surrounding Jared Wilson's post on marital sex on The Gospel Coalition blog, and <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/on-triggering-and-the-triggered-part-2/" target="_blank">he has now published a second part to his response</a>. While it is helpful as a whole, I found his discussion on how the internet has changed the way we discuss things like this especially helpful. So much so, in fact, that I thought it was worth reproducing his main points. Alastair writes,</p>
<blockquote>
I don&rsquo;t think that we reflect enough on the manner in which the  current form of the Internet affects the manner in which we discuss  things and the manner in which ideas spread, and how significantly the  Internet has changed over the last 10-15 years. Here are a few of the  key changes:
<ol>
<li><strong>A collapsing of contexts</strong>. As the  Internet became more connected, contexts once fairly hermetically  sealed started to collide with each other. The writings of someone [more obscure] were exposed to a much wider audience, many of whom had  little notion of the sort of unusual cultural and ideological world it  originated from. With this collapsing of contexts comes the realization  that there are people in close relational networks to us who hold  radically different beliefs and exposure to those opinions.</li>
<li><strong>A decontextualization of thought</strong>.  With the loss of highly distinct cultural contexts, theological  communication was increasingly likely to have to abandon peculiar  contextual idioms and ideological dialects and accommodate itself to a  less defined readership. The readership, in turn, came to presume the  ready intelligibility of thoughts arising from different contexts to  persons within their own. This leads to a forgetfulness of context, and  the manner in which deeper shared cultural knowledge can permit less  guarded formulations. One&rsquo;s audiences became potentially much less  defined or circumscribable. In such an environment it is harder to hold  straight-talking conversations without more sensitive individuals being  exposed to them. The possibility of having one&rsquo;s position reduced to a  decontextualized soundbite is also greatly increased.</li>
<li><strong>A personalizing of ideas</strong>. As the Internet becomes  more oriented around social networking, the way that we engage with  ideas changes. Ideas become far less distinct from personal relations,  as ideas follow the trajectories of social networking connections.  Rather than having to go out of our immediate space and into a public  conversation to encounter challenging and threatening ideas, they start  to intrude upon our private spaces. It is far more likely for emotions  to be prominent in such a debate...</li>
<li><strong>A collision of undifferentiated conversations.</strong> Following on from the previous point, there are different sorts of  conversations. Some conversations are designed to be intimate,  affirming, non-threatening, welcoming, and accepting. Other  conversations are designed to be combative, disputational,  confrontational, and challenging. Some people find the former type of  conversation incredibly stifling and relish the latter. Other people  find the latter form of conversation very threatening and unsettling and  need the former. The former conversation affirms people in  non-threatening difference: the latter conversation challenges people to  defend their differences against strong criticism. The former welcomes  the expression of emotion: the latter gives emotion no privilege or  protection in the conversation (all emotion is not excluded). As  contexts collapse, it is far more difficult to keep these radically  different forms of conversations from colliding. When they do, lots of  heat is created and virtually no light whatsoever.<br /><br />Most people lack the training, reasoning ability, confidence, or  self-mastery necessary to engage in challenging conversation. This  wasn&rsquo;t so much of a problem when such conversations were limited to  closely defined contexts, generally engaged in by trained  representatives of positions, rather than by more vulnerable people, who  would feel threatened by the ideas raised, but lack the skills or  temperament with which to attack them. In the past, it was much easier  to leave the theological conflicts to one&rsquo;s pastor, for instance:  nowadays they turn up in your Facebook newsfeed.</li>
<li><strong>Decreased moderation of and democratization of discourse. </strong>Almost  all of us have many means of broadcasting and sharing our positions  nowadays. In the past, these means were far more limited, and few people  had them. Most conversations would be bounded and moderated, and people  who didn&rsquo;t belong or who didn&rsquo;t play by the rules could be excluded for  their own good, for the health of the conversation, and the focus of  the group. When everyone has means of self-expression and participates  in less bounded conversations, there is a lot more noise surrounding the  signal and it is harder to keep discussions on target.</li>
<li><strong>The spread and speed of thought. </strong>The breakdown of  contextual boundaries and the rapidity of the spread of information  makes emotional reactivism so much easier... There is less time within which to rally one&rsquo;s wits and arguments  when faced with something that offends you. The speed of communication  and the pace at which conversations move and develop gives us little  time for consideration, reflection, and patient processing. As the  initial reaction all too often sets the terms for the conversation that  follows, this encourages far more emotionally freighted conversations  (also as we find ourselves trying to keep faith with our original  emotional reactions, trying to maintain self-consistency and not wanting  to appear to back down). Being encouraged to make up our minds in a  matter of minutes, in the heat of the moment, we are far more at risk of  reacting, rather than responding.</li>
</ol>
I believe that all of these factors can be seen to have shaped the  evolution of the recent conflict to some extent. I do not believe that  such an environment is generally conducive to productive and challenging  discourse. Until we start to become conscious about the ways that it  shapes things, I suspect that many of the problems that it produces will  only continue.

Alastair provides some really helpful insights into the way the internet has changed discussion and debate. What do you think?
