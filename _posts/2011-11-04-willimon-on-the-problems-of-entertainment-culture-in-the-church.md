William Willimon, in his book *[Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0687045320/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0687045320)*, writes on the problems of pastors and churches that subsume the entertainment culture into their paradigm of ministry:

<blockquote>
No medium is neutral. The medium shapes and reforms the message, transforming the message even as it purports to be delivering it. An entertainment culture tends to consume Christian worship. The sincerity and concern conveyed by the media preacher are only apparent. Among the media mogul's failings is an inadequate ecclesiology. The virtual church made through electronic media is less than church, where, to extend Paul's corporeal analogy, the eye has no opportunity ever to meet the foot. There is no flesh for incarnation. The fundamental form of the Christian church as a participatory body, the character of the pastor as one who knows the flock and is known by the flock, is changed by immersion into the modern 'entertainment culture.' The primary function of television is entertainment, whereas the purpose of the gospel is transformation. Furthermore, when we are holding the TV remote control, we are in control of what can be said and shown to us. There is thus little opportunity to be jumped from behind by grace.
