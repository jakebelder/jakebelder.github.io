<span style="font-size:small"><strong>Update (07 Aug 2013):</strong> <em>On reflection, I feel I reacted pretty strongly to this, and perhaps should have been more thoughtful in my response. I recognise as well that some of my statements don't reflect the Church of England's official position as detailed in <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/churchlawlegis/canons/section-b.aspx#Head1-35">the section on baptism in the Canons</a>. My only intention in writing this post was to get us thinking seriously about this incredibly important part of the church's life and worship. Baptism, as one of the means of grace, is not something we can take lightly.</em></strong></span>

The [Church of England](http://www.churchofengland.org) published an article on its website yesterday called ‘[Top 10 facts about Christenings](http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/07/top-10-facts-about-christenings.aspx)’. My initial reaction after reading it was to bang my head against my desk several times, but I thought it would be more constructive instead to repost the article here and offer some more helpful and biblical answers to the questions posed. The original article appears in blockquotes.

<blockquote>
<strong>Top 10 facts about Christenings</strong><br>
The Church of England carries out more than 10,000 christenings per month each year for babies and infants. This figure is made up of approximately 7000 christenings per month for babies under one year old, and 3000 christenings per month for children aged 1-12 years.   Everyone is welcome to have a christening in their parish church. Here is a list of the most frequently asked questions about getting your baby or child christened.<br><br>

<strong>1. What is the difference between a baptism and a christening?</strong><br>
There is no difference between a christening service and a baptism service.  Some churches will use the word 'baptism' and some the word 'christening'.  Babies are 'baptised' during a 'christening' service just as couples are 'married' during a wedding service.<br><br>

Christening is a traditional English word which means to become a member of the Christian church. Baptism means to be immersed in water.  During a christening service a baby or child will be baptised with water and welcomed into the community of the local church.
</blockquote>

Okay, fine. There are some debates about what the word ‘baptism’ actually means, but we can leave those aside for now as this is a fairly minor issue compared to some of the other things in this article.

<blockquote>
<strong>2. What is baptism?</strong><br>
"Baptism marks the beginning of a journey with God which continues for the rest of our lives, the first step in response to God's love."  It is also a celebration, a time to come together with family and friends; remembering that your child is loved by God, is part of a wider community and has a place with God's people.
</blockquote>

There are grains of truth here, but this is hardly a sufficient definition of baptism. To begin with, why this vagueness about a "journey with God"? Paul is clear in Romans 6:3 that baptism is all about union with Christ, something also made clear in the liturgy for baptism in the Prayer Book. And instead of this curiously unreferenced quote, why not quote from the Church of England’s doctrinal standard, the 39 Articles, which offers a much fuller and much more clear statement about what baptism is? “Baptism…is a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed.” Forget the flaky definition above. Baptism is all about the gospel. If you want someone to understand what baptism is, they first need to understand the gospel.

And although it’s true that baptism is the beginning of a “journey with God which continues for the rest of our lives,” let’s be clear about what exactly that means. Having a child baptised doesn’t mean they are on a journey straight to heaven. Jesus says in Matthew 7:13-14 that there are actually two journeys you can go on, and when parents have their child baptised, they are responsible for ensuring that the child sets out on the right one. Yes, a child, just like everyone else, will always be on a “journey with God,” but will that journey be with God as the loving Father, or with God as the righteous judge? It’s certainly worth coming together with family and friends to celebrate the former. But don't be under any illusions that baptism guarantees a child will be saved and go to heaven.

<blockquote>
<strong>3. What happens in the service?</strong><br>
Christenings are services replete with symbols for new life. At your baby's christening water will be blessed and used to pour on the baby's head. The baby will be signed with the cross, a special oil may be used for this, and a candle may be given. Godparents and parents will make promises on behalf of the baby, and prayers will be offered for the baby and the family. There may also be readings and hymns, which you may be able to choose.
</blockquote>

All churches will walk parents through the order of the service, but unfortunately, there will also be churches that will not help them understand what baptism itself is actually all about, nor will they teach the parents about the promises they will be asked to make. As a result, parents end up participating in a sacrament that they don’t understand, and end up making promises they can’t keep. All the symbols for new life then become, instead, symbols of judgement (just think of the Flood).

<blockquote>
<strong>4. Does a christening give my baby a name?</strong><br>
No. Your baby's name is given when you register the birth. During the baptism, the baby's name will be used often, and when the water is poured over the child's head, the vicar will always use the name.
</blockquote>

It’s true, the parents pick the name. But baptism does confer a new identity on a child, and obligates the parents to raise them to live according to that new identity. (And you thought choosing a name for the child was a big responsibility...)

<blockquote>
<strong>5. Who is allowed to have a christening service?</strong><br>
The Church of England welcomes all babies, children and families - whatever shape that family takes. You do not have to be married to ask for a christening for your child.  You do not have to be an active churchgoer - as parents, you do not even have to have been christened yourselves. Everyone is welcome at their local church.
</blockquote>

People often like to say that you don't *need* to go to church to be a Christian, but the reality is that if you are committed to Christ, you will be committed to his people. Though simply attending church is not a good indicator of your spiritual condition, *not* regularly attending church is. What's more, for parents who want their children baptised, they will promise to raise their child to be a part of the church. How will they do that if they don’t come to church?

What's more, parents who want their children baptised actually *do* need to be baptised themselves, because only covenant parents (those who have been united with Christ and his church themselves) can bring children forward for baptism. That's how the covenant works. As Peter says, "The promise is for you and your children" (Acts 2:38-39). If you are a parent who wants your child baptised and you don't understand what the covenant is, ask the vicar of your local church, who should be able to explain it to you. Understanding the covenant is key to understanding baptism.

But if the parents haven’t been baptised, then a church with a biblical theology of baptism should be happy to tell them all about what it means to follow Jesus, and if the parents then want to take that next step and commit to following him, the church will be happy to baptise them and their children together. And these are really exciting occasions!

<blockquote>
<strong>6. How much does a christening service cost?</strong><br>
The good news is that a christening service is free.  There may be costs for a family party, for gifts, for christening robes - but the church is free.
</blockquote>

You may not have to spend any money, but in reality, it costs *a lot* – for parents, it will mean devoting the whole of their lives to teaching their children what it means to follow Jesus. And for the child, it means they will grow up to surrender the whole of their lives to Jesus. In short, it costs *everything*.

<blockquote>
<strong>7. Where can I hold the christening?</strong><br>
You can have your baby christened at your local parish church. If you want to have the christening at a different church, for example, where you grew up or where you were married, you will need to talk to the vicar at that church.
</blockquote>

Really, though, parents should have their child baptised at the church they regularly attend, since the congregation promises to help them raise the child to know and love Jesus.

<blockquote>
<strong>8. When can I have a christening?</strong><br>
You can have your baby or child christened at any age. There is no upper age limit, but after about the age of seven your child should be able to make the promises for themselves.<br><br>

The service is usually held as part of a main Sunday service in the local church, but there are also opportunities to have a service at a different time, again usually on a Sunday. Talk to the vicar, and ask their advice.
</blockquote>

The baptism should always take place within a Sunday service, because, again, the whole congregation will make promises to help the parents raise their child to know and love Jesus. Not only that, but why would you place upon your child a sign that they belong to the community of believers and not have the community of believers witness this?

<blockquote>
<strong>9. What about godparents?</strong><br>
The involvement of godparents can be one of the most joyful parts of the christening.<br><br>

Godparents are not necessarily the people who will care for your child should anything happen to you. Rather they should be people who will be there for your child and help them think about the bigger questions in life - questions of love, hope and faith.<br><br>

Every child should have no fewer than three godparents, at least two of the same sex as the child. Parents may be godparents for their own children, providing they have at least one other godparent.<br><br>

Godparents must be baptised themselves and old enough to make some serious promises on behalf of the child.
</blockquote>

Now, this is interesting, and more than a little confusing. So godparents should be baptised, but parents don’t have to be? But parents can be the godparents, even though it said in question 5 that parents don't need to be baptised themselves? How does that make any sense?

It should be noted as well that, according to Deuteronomy 6:7, the parents have the primary responsibility for teaching the faith to their children (see also Ephesians 6:4). Godparents can certainly play a role in this, but really, the whole local church community should act as godparents.

<blockquote>
<strong>10. How do I arrange a christening?</strong><br>
Simply contact the vicar of the church where you want to hold the christening and ask for advice.
</blockquote>

If the vicar has a biblical theology of baptism, their advice will be that parents who are not believers and members of the church go through a course exploring Christianity before they even begin to talk about baptism. The vicar should be honest with the parents and tell them that they need to be committed followers of Jesus in order to make the promises they are required to make. If the parents then decide that they cannot make that commitment, and cannot make those promises with every intention of keeping them, the child should not be baptised. However, the church will be happy to do a thanksgiving for the child during a service, praying that the family as a whole will come to know and love Jesus.

Hopefully this helps to clear up some of the confusion. I would just note in closing that the Church of England would significantly clear up its theology of baptism if it simply looked at what the Prayer Book and the 39 Articles (not to mention the Bible!) said about baptism. Then we wouldn't have stuff like this appearing on the internet, causing even more confusion.
