Graeme Goldsworthy, from his book, [*According to Plan: The Unfolding Revelation of God in the Bible*](http://www.amazon.com/According-Plan-Unfolding-Revelation-Bible/dp/0830826963/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-8376369-7838361?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192817169&sr=8-1):

<blockquote>
The Christian is a believer in Jesus Christ. That obvious fact should not escape us! The word of the gospel takes hold of us and, by the Holy Spirit's power, turns us from darkness to light, that is, turns us to Christ. The gospel is the message of the kingdom of God as it comes through the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth. The gospel centers on the birth, life, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus as God's way of saving us from death and of making us members of his eternal kingdom.<br><br>

As we begin the Christian life by placing our whole trust in the Christ of the gospel event, so in the same way we continue in the Christian life. The gospel not only brings us to new birth and faith as Christians; it is God's means of saving us totally. The gospel is the power of God for salvation (Rom. 1:16), and this means the whole of salvation for the whole person. Thus the gospel converts us, the gospel sustains us in the Christian life and brings us to maturity and the gospel brings us to perfection through our resurrection from the dead.<br><br>

An important part of salvation is having our rebellious minds and wills changed so that they become compliant to the Word of God. The Christian can no longer think like an atheistic humanist. The truth-suppressing mind is overcome by the Holy Spirit, who brings it to accept and believe the gospel. This renewing of the mind is a continuous process (Rom. 12:2), and it means that the Christian develops the mindset of Christian theism. Since our perfection is not reached in this life, we all retain some measure of humanistic thinking. We must continually strive to overcome this evil through the power of the gospel (47-48).
