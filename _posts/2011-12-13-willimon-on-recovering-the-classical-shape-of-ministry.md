<p>Over the past month, I have (very) slowly been making my way through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Willimon">William Willimon's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001Q3M0TE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B001Q3M0TE"><em>Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry</em></a>. In a section discussing different images and models of pastoral ministry, Willimon suggests the recovery of a classical form of Christian ministry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">There is much to be said for the pastor being educated in the classical forms of Christian ministry. The church has much experience as a minority movement. We need to draw from that experience today. In that regard, I predict a recovery of the classical shape of ministry: to teach, to preach, and to evangelize through the ministries of the Word, sacrament, and order. I sense the end of a proliferation of ministerial duties and a reclamation of the essential classical tasks of Christian ministry. Because so many of our people have not been well formed in the faith, pastors must now stress doctrine, the classical texts of our faith, our master narratives, the great themes. The culture is no longer a prop for the church. If we are going to make Christians, we must have a new determination to inculcate the faith. In some ways our age parallels that of the Reformation, in which the church was faced with a vast undereducated, uninformed, unformed laity and clergy. Pastors need to be prepared to lead in catechesis, moral formation, and the regeneration of God's people.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues that we no longer live in a culture where Christianity holds a prominent place. As Christians, we are now living in a context in which the idea of being aliens and strangers in the land must be recovered. This was the situation of the early church, and it shaped the way they carried out their ministry. In particular, they invested a great deal of time and energy into the formation of believers. As we now find ourselves in a similar context, Willimon suggests that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">more of our pastoral time, in this missionary situation, will be spent in catechesis, the formation of Christians who have the equipment they need to survive as Christians.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often hear people react against the idea of catechesis because of an assumption that it is mere indoctrination, drilling purely intellectual and academic theological propositions into the heads of children. This, unfortunately, may have been the experience of some &ndash; to be honest, this was partly my own experience &ndash; but Willimon helpfully points out that catechesis instead is about the holistic formation of believers, equipping them with the tools necessary not only to think rightly, but to <em>live</em> rightly in the world.</p>
<p>In order to understand more fully what catechesis is supposed to entail, it is helpful first to have a well-rounded definition of the practice. The <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> provides one such definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catechesis...[includes] especially the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and systematic way, with a view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life....catechesis is built on a certain number of elements of the Church's pastoral mission...[including] the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary preaching to arouse faith; examination of the reasons for belief; experience of Christian living; celebration of the sacraments; integration into the ecclesial community; and apostolic and missionary witness (II, 5-6).</span></p>
</blockquote>

Catechesis is not just about intellectual matters, but it is about the whole of the Christian life. Recovering this sort of ministry is crucial for discipleship, and thus of great importance for pastoral ministry.
