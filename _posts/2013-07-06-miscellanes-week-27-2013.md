Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>30 June-06 July 2013</strong>.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/129BYjQ">Naturalizing "Shalom": Confessions of a Kuyperian Secularist</a></strong> – A great article by <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> exploring the idea of <em>shalom</em> from a Kuyperian perspective and urging careful thought on how we pursue justice in this world. Specifically cautioning that don't become so focused on this world that we lose sight of the fact that true <em>shalom</em> can only be the work of God, he concludes with this brilliant line: "<em>Shalom</em> is not biblical language for progressivist social amelioration. <em>Shalom</em> is a Christ-haunted call to long for kingdom come."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cMEhiA">Beliefs Are Not Set in Stone, Except for When They're on Tablets</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> contributes a guest post to the <a href="http://twitter.com/mereorthodoxy">Mere Orthodoxy</a> blog challenging <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/27/opinion-not-all-religious-convictions-are-written-in-stone/?utm_content=bufferb4617&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer">a recent piece by Rachel Held Evans</a> in which she argues that we need to be willing to have our beliefs challenged because they are not set in stone. Rishmawy helpfully counters her argument by demonstrating how the biblical example she uses to make her point doesn't really work, and notes that, quite simply, there are plenty of things God has written down plainly that must shape our beliefs and practices.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/03/21/monk-complaints-manuscripts/">Oh, My Hand: Complaints Medieval Monks Scribbled in the Margins of Illuminated Manuscripts</a></strong> – This is really quite humorous. Turns out some medieval monks weren't all that excited about the work of copying books!</li>
