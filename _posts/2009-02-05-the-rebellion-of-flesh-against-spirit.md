[Klaas Schilder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas_Schilder), from his book, *[Christ in His Sufferings](http://www.amazon.com/Klaas-Schilder-Trilogy-Suffering-Crucified/dp/B001EHGPAW/kataiwannhn-20)*:

<blockquote>
And for the Saviour, fully aflame as He is with love for mankind, it is far worse suffering to meet a satan of flesh and blood than to confront that one great Devil who is sheer spirit. Jesus Himself is human. He called Simon Barjona a friend. And a friend’s opposition to the task which God placed upon the Son of Man is a burden outweighing a thousand times the enmity to Him and the Father breathed out by the Demon of the pit.<br><br>

Hearing His bride speak and act satanically, seeing a human being, one of those for whom He is giving His life, become an instrument of Satan, observing the flesh in Simon Peter assert itself to take exception to heaven’s law of atonement through fulfillment, and all that, mark well, at the moment of Christ’s prophesying — that must have been Jesus’ severest suffering up to this time. For He knows all the while that this same rebellion of flesh against spirit will presently nail Him to the cross.
</blockquote>

I actually shuddered when I read this the first time.
