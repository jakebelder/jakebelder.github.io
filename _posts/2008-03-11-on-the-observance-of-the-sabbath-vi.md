<p>If we understand the Sabbath to be a creation ordinance (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%202:2-3;&amp;version=31;">Gen. 2:2-3</a>) rather than a Mosaic ordinance (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex.%2020:8-11;&amp;version=47;">Ex. 20:8-11</a>), and also understand it to be the destiny of man (that is, our eschatological rest, as per <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb%203:7-4:13;&amp;version=47;">Heb. 3:7-4:13</a>), then the implications of what it means to observe that day should be relatively clear.</p>

I emphasize <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span>.  I am still confused.  More to follow.  I know I said I'd leave the issue to rest, but I can't.
