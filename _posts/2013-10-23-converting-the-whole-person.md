A lot of my recent reading has been geared towards getting a better grasp of Anglicanism and ministry within an Anglican context. One of the things I have been delighted to discover as I have read material from the 16th century and through to today is that the Anglican tradition has long had an emphasis on whole-life discipleship. Even as far back as Hugh Latimer, [Anglicans have been saying that the gospel shapes the whole of our life](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/being-holy-is-about-living-faithfully-in-whatever-you-do).

One of the books that was recommended to me was Michael Ramsey's book, *[The Christian Priest Today](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0281061165/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0281061165&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. [Ramsey, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ramsey), put the book together as a means of helping those who were exploring ministry to understand what ordained ministry was all about and what it might look like, particularly in the Anglican tradition. As I was reading, I was encouraged to see him bring this whole-life focus into view again:

<blockquote>
First, let us agree that the first priority is to preach the gospel to men and women so that they may be converted to our Lord. But if a person is to be truly converted the conversion must embrace all his personal and social relationships. He does not exist in a vacuum. He is a man, a creature in God's own image; he is a husband, a father, an uncle, a neighbour, an employer or a manager or a workman, a citizen; he has amusements, hobbies, leisure, money, income, savings, health or sickness, power or impotence, wealth or poverty. Convert him, you say. So be it, but the Christ to whom you convert him wants the whole of him. When Paul and Silas were in prison at Philippi and there was an earthquake and they were liberated and the jailer was converted and, with his whole household, baptized, it was a <em>jailer</em> who was converted, not a man in a vacuum; and we would hope that as a Christian jailer he was a different person in his dealings with people and with his job. I suggest that there are three broadly contrasted procedures. It is possible to preach the gospel of conversion without any sight of its social context. It is possible to preach a social gospel which omits the reality of conversion to Christ. Be it your wisdom to preach the gospel of conversion, making it clear that it is the whole man with all his relationships who is converted to Jesus as the Lord of all he is and does (36-37).
</blockquote>

This is a theme I keep coming back to because [a gospel that doesn't take into account the whole of life is narrow and trivial](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/what-is-the-answer-to-narrow-and-trivial-christianity), and a ministry which only looks to 'getting people into heaven' ultimately fails to honour the claim that Jesus is Lord over all of life. In practice that claim ends up being restricted to so-called 'spiritual life'. This is owing, in many cases, to [an understanding of humanity that is rooted in the fall, and not creation](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/our-humanity-is-rooted-in-creation-not-the-fall). If Christ is truly Lord over all, however, [a lot more is demanded of us](http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html).

For those of us in ministry, our evangelism and discipleship goes far beyond just getting people's souls sorted. [John Pritchard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pritchard_%28bishop%29), the bishop of Oxford, has rightly said, 'The goal of ministry is that men and women in every place may have life in all its fullness and abundance.' And we find that life only as we submit *every single part* of ourselves to Jesus.
