Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>20-26 April 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jKe5tt">The Resurrection and Good Funerals</a></strong> – Here is a really good interview with a Christian funeral director over on <a href="http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation">The Washington Institute's</a> blog. He has some really helpful reflections on what makes a good funeral, and it's also a great example of a Christian thinking carefully about their vocation and the flourishing of those he serves through his work.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1f2AqW1">What’s love got to do with it?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/MartinBDavie">Martin Davie</a> writes, "Good Friday and Easter Day force us to re-think our understanding of what it means to say that God loves us. God’s love involves far more than simply benevolent affirmation. It involves the death and resurrection of Christ so that we may die and rise with him to a new life with God."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jKizA4">The Father’s Grief and the Rent Veil</a></strong> – <a href="http://www.calvarymemorial.com/about/staff/#biogerald">Gerald Heistand</a> draws some interesting connections between the Father's grief when Jesus dies, the temple curtain, and the robes of the High Priest.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lI8gOt">Let’s Not Get the Hell Out of Here</a></strong> – <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/timothygeorge_1">Timothy George</a>, in this interesting piece, writes about the line in the Apostles' Creed where we confess that Christ descended into hell, and the significance of what happened on that day between his death and resurrection.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mHxUXp">Holy Relics: The Church Pew</a></strong> – Over at <a href="http://twitter.com/christandpc">Christ and Pop Culture</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/martynwendell">Martyn Jones</a> waxes eloquent about church pews and what they represent. I found it a particularly interesting piece after I wrote something <a href="http://bit.ly/1mHxUXs">against pews</a> a few weeks ago.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lI8xku">On children's participation in the liturgy: some Easter observations</a></strong> – As someone who favours the participation of children in corporate worship, I enjoyed <a href="http://twitter.com/FaithTheology">Ben Myers'</a> personal reflections on bringing his children to an early morning Easter service. We vastly underestimate both the formative power of worship and what children learn through observation and experience.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1htm0wW">Pedophiles in the Church</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/uribrito">Uri Brito</a> raises a conversation on a very difficult, but important issue. While he acknowledges the power of grace to transform someone, he personally advocates that pedophiles not be allowed to worship in the presence of children. Whatever you think of his conclusions, this is a discussion that needs to be had.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1nMvPqy">A Prayer for Death</a></strong> – Here are some interesting reflections on the significance of praying the Lord's Prayer. The author writes, "The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer for our own death. It is against us as much as it is for us... To pray for God’s kingdom coming is to pray that his will <em>will</em> be done. We are not always as interested in that as we think, because in praying for God’s will to come to us, we are coincidentally praying to preclude our own will from ever coming at all. We die right there."</li>
