Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

It's quite an encouraging story.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aUopJR">I'm Gay, but I'm Not Switching to a Church That Supports Gay Marriage</a></strong> – A great piece in <em>The Atlantic</em> by a woman who struggles with same-sex attraction but is determined to remain in a church where she is encouraged to live faithfully.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aUpfqe">Calvinist Baptists, But No ‘Lutheran’ Baptists?</a></strong> – <a href="@ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a> muses over this very intriguing question of why there are some Baptists who identify as Calvinists but none who identify as Lutherans...</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15Cdh44">As the House of Lords debates same-sex marriage...</a></strong> – The well-known British blogger who operates under the pseudonym, <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace">Archbishop Cranmer</a>, is one of the clearest voices on the same-sex marriage issue.
