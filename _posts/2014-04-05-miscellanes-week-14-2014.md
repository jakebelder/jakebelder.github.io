Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>30 March-05 April 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lxDcEu">On the Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage in England and Wales</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> offers a helpful and thoughtful response to the recent changes in marriage law here in the UK.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lxY7ak">God Save us from our Answers</a></strong> – This is a great post on the need to ask questions, and avoiding the temptation to always assume we know the answers already. That often means we are trying to fit Jesus into our ready-made answers as well. But the author writes, "If sin means one thing, it is that I am fluent in the language of self-deception; that I am ready to speak and live as if 'I know' too quickly. Like the resurrection, the truth so often emerges as a holy disruption. And as George Hunsinger says: 'Grace that is not disruptive is not grace.'"</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hU49vg">The "Response Book": A Few Reflections on a Uniquely Evangelical Phenomenon</a></strong> – Here is a really interesting post on why evangelicals devote way too much time and attention to addressing and responding to non-evangelicals they disagree with, and what that communicates about evangelicalism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/6dvkBdXLx3A">Facing the Canon with Archbishop Justin Welby</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/canonjjohn">Canon J.John</a> hosted an interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://twitter.com/JustinWelby">Justin Welby</a>, a few weeks ago. It's a good, wide-ranging and enjoyable interview.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hkjKTW">April 3, AD 33</a></strong> – Some evangelical scholars have argued in this interesting piece that this is the exact date Jesus died.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1q4otA9">‘Catching Sleep’ & Catching the Spirit (Or, a Note on the Phenomenology of The Spiritual Disciplines)</a></strong> – The title of <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy's</a> post says it all, I suppose. If we want to be faithful in practising the spiritual disciplines, it begins with the right posture.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dT3MWl">Selfish Salvation</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/uribrito">Uri Brito</a> posts a thought-provoking critique of the paradigm of salvation portrayed in John Bunyan's classic, <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>.</li>
