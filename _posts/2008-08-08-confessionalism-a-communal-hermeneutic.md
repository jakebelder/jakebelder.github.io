<p>Some time ago I engaged in quite a <a href="http://jakebelder.com/it-just-doesnt-work-rethinking-the-sunday-ser">discussion here on this blog</a> in regards to George Barna and Frank Viola's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pagan-Christianity-Exploring-Church-Practices/dp/141431485X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210004652&amp;sr=8-1">Pagan Christianity</a></em>. A recent commenter informed me that a sequel to that book is out, entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reimagining-Church-Pursuing-Organic-Christianity/dp/1434768759/ref=pd_sim_b_5">Reimagining Church</a></em>. When I saw the comment appear in the new comments section on the sidebar, I clicked through to read it, and saw an earlier comment by a fellow named Robert. He raised the question of what we are saying when we say we must obey God in regards to how we think about the Church, and said that by doing so, we "remain stuck in the realm of opinions."</p>
<p>He has a valid point. Any theological discussion, including ecclesiology, necessarily involves hermeneutics. And just as diverse as humanity is, so is our approach to hermeneutics diverse. The Bible remains somewhat ambiguous on the specifics of worship and gathering together as the people of God, and thus some interpretive work is necessary. But how do we work on finding answers if each person reads Scripture in a different light?</p>
<p>This, I think, makes a good case for confessionalism. Careful theological reflection on these issues should be done by a communal body that seeks to prayerfully consider the various interpretations of the biblical texts. Bringing together those who are equipped for the task of determining the position of the body on these issues is not only helpful, it is essential. It is not only a determinant of truth, but a protection from error.</p>
<p>That being said, it should not be expected that a theological position be maintained indefinitely. Our positions should consistently be checked against Scripture to ensure that they are in conformity with it. What was laid out as true five hundred years ago may be seen in a different light today, but may just as well still be glorifying to God. Our minds must consistently remain open in this regard.</p>

One of the tasks of the Church is to be the guardian of the Truth. We must not allow ourselves <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11-16;&amp;version=31;">to be blown by every wind of doctrine</a>. No matter what you think of confessionalism--I would not yet consider myself a full-fledged confessionalist, though I see its merits--in its hermeneutical functioning it is greatly helpful, for only in community can the Truth be rightly upheld and preserved.
