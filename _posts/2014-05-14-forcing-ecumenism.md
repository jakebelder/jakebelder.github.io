Over at *[First Things](http://www.firstthings.com/)*, [Matthew Milliner](http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/M/Matthew-Milliner) shares [some observations on a recent trip to Sweden](http://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/06/not-so-secular-sweden) with some fascinating insights into the way the increasing pressure of secularism is forcing ecumenism amongst the country's remaining Christians. He notes,

<blockquote>
Overwhelmed by it all, I announce that whereas American Christianity is a mile wide and an inch deep, Swedish Christianity is an inch wide and a mile deep. Never have I seen ecumenical cooperation as I have here. I unfurl a grand analogy: Under secularism’s tectonic pressure, the continents of differing traditions are drifting closer together. As the landmasses merge, some jump to another side, while others remain. But the merging of continents is far more significant than isolated bounds, however athletically impressive. <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/march/sweden-pentecostal-converts-catholicism-ulf-ekman-word-life.html">Personal conversions, despite the attention they can generate</a>, are small change compared with the payoff of broader ecclesial union. And toward this goal, Sweden—thanks to the remarkable <a href="http://ekumeniskakommuniteten.se/">Bjärka-Säby</a>—seems decades ahead.
</blockquote>

It is interesting to note that the ecumenism Milliner observes is happening outside of liberal Christianity. Usually when we think of ecumenism, we think of the the sort of nondescript 'unity' that is characteristic of ecumenical activity in those circles. This appears to be something quite different. I also find his observations particularly striking following on from the recent conversation between [Peter Leithart, Fred Sanders, and Carl Trueman on the future of Protestantism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKekHEco87U), and imagine Leithart might look rather favourably on these developments.

The future, of course, is largely unknowable, but I do not think it is inconceivable that this sort of forced ecumenism will increasingly happen across Europe and the United Kingdom, as well as North America, as Christianity is pushed to the margins. Perhaps it is even a 'gift' of secularism that we are pushed closer together in unity and required to listen to and understand each other. But what is happening in Sweden might not happen in every context, and no matter how much we speculate about future developments, the reality is that we must simply wait and see what happens – and where the Spirit leads.

*(**Update:** Phil Whittall, who is planting a church in Sweden, has some [very interesting reflections on Milliner's observations here](http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/inch-wide-mile-deep/).)*
