<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>13-19 January 2013</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2012/12/28/in-praise-of-denominations/" target="_blank"><strong>In Praise of Denominations</strong></a> - Not many people look with favour on the idea of denominations any more these days, but the author of this post argues that they still have merit, for a variety of different reasons. He makes some valid points, particularly with regard to confessional and theological unity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/evangelicals-gender-homosexuality-part-2/" target="_blank"><strong>Evangelicals, gender &amp; homosexuality</strong></a> - There has been a lot of conversation lately on these topics, and especially the latter, as self-identified evangelical <a href="http://www.oasisuk.org/inclusionresources/Articles/MOI" target="_blank">Steve Chalke recently came out in support of committed homosexual relationships</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor" target="_blank">Phil Whittall</a> has some helpful thoughts and has collected a variety of links on the current debate on his blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://yorkshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/ten-reasons-to-love-hull-45779/" target="_blank"><strong>Ten reasons to love Hull</strong></a> - Here's a short article on some of the good things and interesting features of my city. The article states, 'Hull is a city of unique character and appeal, underpinned by an inherent sense of belonging and friendliness,' and I'll certainly echo that.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://jrwoodward.net/2013/01/urban-disciple-by-aj-sherrill/" target="_blank">Urban Disciple by AJ Sherrill</a></strong> - A new discipleship resource has just been published, which <a href="http://twitter.com/jrwoodward" target="_blank">JR Woodward</a> highlights on his blog. It works through the Gospel of Matthew, and is designed to use the truth of Scripture to equip people for prayer and mission. There's a video trailer at the bottom of the post that introduces the material.</li>
<li><a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_silence_can_be_golden_says_american_expert/6454371" target="_blank"><strong>Finnish silence can be golden</strong></a> - There is a stereotype of Finns that says they are quiet and reserved, but I think there is something we can learn from the Finns when it comes to conversation. </li>
