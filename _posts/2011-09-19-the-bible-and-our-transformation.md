<p>Our church's <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/homegrp.htm">home groups</a> are studying Romans 12-16 this term, and this past week we looked closely at <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ro12.1">Romans 12:1-2</a>. We spent quite a bit of time discussing the idea that we must be 'transformed by the renewing of your minds', and how we work this transformation out in practice. The group that meets at our home talked about the importance of recognising the role of Scripture in this renewing of our minds. This meant devoting ourselves to sitting under the preaching of the Word, engaging in the study of the Bible in groups and individually, and so on.</p>
<p>Some years ago, I remember reading a portion of Don Carson and Douglas Moo's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844740897/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1844740897"><em>An Introduction to the New Testament</em></a>, that related to this discussion of the importance of the Word of God in our transformation. In their chapter on the book of Acts, they write this:</p>
<blockquote>
An easily overlooked theme in Acts is the power of the word of God. Again and again, Luke attributes the growth and strength of the church to the dynamic activity of God's word. Preaching the world of God is what the apostles do wherever they go. 'Received the word of God' is another way of saying 'became a Christian' (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac11.1">Acts 11:1</a>). Especially striking are those places where Luke, usually in transitional summaries, claims that the word of God 'grew' or 'spread' or 'increased' (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac6.7">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac12.24">12:24</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac13.49">13:49</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac19.20">19:20</a>). For Luke the word of God is especially the message about God's gracious redemption through Jesus Christ. For all Luke's emphasis on the importance of apostolic preaching, therefore, he makes clear that it is only as they are faithful witnesses to the Word that spiritual transformation takes place. As C. K. Barrett notes, 'Luke's stress on the proclamation of the Word...shows that the Word itself was the decisive factor,' and that the church is an agency of salvation 'only in so far as it provides the framework within which the preaching of the Word takes place.'
</blockquote>

It really testifies to the significance of Scripture in the transformation of people that Luke gave it so much emphasis in Acts. And as we see in Romans 12, Paul felt the same way. If we are to be truly transformed, we must allow the Bible to have a prominent place in our lives. As David simply and honestly writes, 'How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word' (Psalm 119:1).
