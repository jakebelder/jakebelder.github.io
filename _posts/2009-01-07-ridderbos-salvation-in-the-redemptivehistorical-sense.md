<p>I am currently working on a post for my ongoing discussion of redemption that I should have published in the next day or two, which will deal with our conception of God and how it relates to our understanding of redemption and salvation.</p>
<p>As I was thinking it through, I pulled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Nicolaas_Ridderbos">Herman Ridderbos</a>' book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Kingdom-Herman-N-Ribberbos/dp/0875524087/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231303583&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Coming of the Kingdom</span></a>, off the shelf again and started reading.  I turn to Ridderbos often when I am thinking about such topics as these because he is an absolute wealth of wisdom and insight into biblical truth.  What I am about to quote I think will help lead into my upcoming post.  Consider what Ridderbos has to say here on God as Father and how it relates to our salvation:</p>

<blockquote>
Wherever Jesus speaks of 'your Father in heaven,' and the 'heavenly Father,' or of 'children of the heavenly Father,' he has in view the exclusive relationship between the Lord and those who will share in the bliss of the kingdom of heaven, and share in it now already.  Here, too, it appears that the new covenant has begun with the kingdom of God, and that those to whom salvation is promised are the new people of God.  But full stress, however, must be laid on this idea of <span style="font-style: italic;">a community</span>.  The salvation Jesus proclaims is a salvation of the people of the Lord...and this also applies to God's Fatherhood.  The whole gospel proves that this relation must not be thought of in an individualistic sense, i.e., it does not in the first place denote a relationship between God and individual human beings, but between the Lord and his people.  This fact is not at all affected by the circumstance that membership with this people in the fullness of time is not due to natural descent from Israel but to personal conversion and faith in Jesus as the Christ.  Sonship to God must be understood in a redemptive-historical sense.  It is the realization of the promise of the new covenant, the continuation and fulfillment of the bond between the Lord and Israel.<br /><br />

...The fact that from the outset God's fatherhood denotes a relation which coalesces with the theocratic relation of the covenant, indicates the close connection between the two.  God's fatherhood over Israel consisted in the fact that he was Israel's king.  And this connection is again and again found in Jesus' preaching.  Jesus teaches his disciples to pray to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Father</span> that his name be hallowed and that his <span style="font-style: italic;">kingdom</span> may come.  The salvation of God's people lay in the fact that he would fully reveal and sanctify himself as king.  The good pleasure of the Father towards his children is his giving them the kingdom (Luke 12:32) [235, 238].</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is only a very cursory lead in to what I'll be expanding on in the next few posts.  What I have quoted here only alludes to the distorted conception of God as Father that many modern evangelicals hold to.  For now what I want to emphasize is what Ridderbos warns against, something I have seen become far too characteristic of evangelicalism&mdash;a thorough individualizing of salvation, which not only takes us away from the heart of the gospel and the true nature of redemption, but also trivializes both God's enthronement as the sovereign King and the covenant He makes between Himself and His people.  Again, I will be returning to all this in forthcoming posts.</p>

For now, any thoughts on what Ridderbos says here?  I would appreciate your insight on this as I go along.
