One section of <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">James K. A. Smith's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802864074?tag=jameskasmithc-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0802864074&amp;adid=0EP91NN55B4YDS42TN56&amp;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Devil Reads Derrida</span></a>, is a collection of essays on the university, entitled "Schools of Faith." The title underscores Smith's recognition of the fact that any educational institution communicates a worldview and is shaped by a certain religious orientation.

The modern American university, Smith says, is every bit as religious as those institutions which intentionally declare themselves as such. These other institutions operate on the false principle that they are educating objectively, with the assumption that the secular is neutral and non-religious. This, of course, is impossible; "indeed, one could suggest that much that goes under the banner of 'secular' education is, in fact, a kind of religious formation where students are initiated into a particular worldview" (56). In the case of the secular institution, this means education reflects the secular commitments of the market and political liberalism, among others.

What this fosters is the mindset that students are <span style="font-style: italic;">consumers</span>. As a defining characteristic of Western culture, Smith argues, this consumerist mentality filters its way into every part of our life such that even our educational institutions become agents in the process of consuming "goods" and "skills," which are intended solely for the benefit of the individual and his or her happiness.

There is another way, however, that does not focus on <span style="font-style: italic;">consuming</span> goods and skills, but <span style="font-style: italic;">acquiring</span> them, a distinction Smith employs to emphasize that <em>acquisition</em> of these things is ultimately for the sake of <span style="font-style: italic;">others</span>&mdash;to be used in service to God and for the good of our neighbors. Here is where a liberal arts education is so important.

<blockquote>
The scandal of the liberal arts education is that it's not about giving people what they want. It's about challenging the wants themselves, and ultimately to form and direct those wants and desires otherwise. My task is to invite students to radically reconsider their wants. The professor's task is not to politely and meekly ask, 'Can I help you find what you're looking for?' Rather, I want to challenge students by asking: 'Why would you be looking for <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>?' A liberal arts education&mdash;and especially a <span style="font-style: italic;">Christian</span> liberal arts education&mdash;should come as a shock to those whose habits have been shaped by a culture of consumerism. This is because the liberal arts are about the <span style="font-style: italic;">formation</span> of students, and the central task of formation runs deeply counter to the egocentric stance fostered by consumerism. The very notion of 'formation' calls into question the autonomy at the heart of consumerism (42).
</blockquote>

Referencing the modal theory of Dutch philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Dooyeweerd">Herman Dooyeweerd</a>, Smith goes on to make the point that the university needs to operate according to its leading function or aspect, and raises the question of whether or not "the paradigm of student-as-consumer indicate[s] that the college is unwittingly letting a secondary, economic aspect trump our leading aspect of education, formation, and research" (44). The answer, of course, is quite clear. And so, Smith concludes,

<blockquote>
while students are here to acquire habits, skills, and wisdom, this does not make them 'consumers' or customers. As an institution focused on the task of education, we are not providing a 'commodity.' And having a unique identity does not just translate into being a 'brand.' In fact, the task of a distinctively Christian liberal arts education is to create a community of people formed to resist and challenge the reductionism of a market-driven culture. To the extent that we do that, we will be faithful to our calling (45).
</blockquote>

Any thoughts on this?
