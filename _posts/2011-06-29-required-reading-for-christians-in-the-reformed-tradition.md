<p>As I mentioned a few posts back, I've been reading <a href="http://www.calvinseminary.edu/aboutUs/facultyStaff/bltj.php">John Bolt's</a> little volume, <em><a href="http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/ChristianAndReformedToday.pdf">Christian and Reformed Today</a></em>. The book is available as a free PDF <a href="http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/ChristianAndReformedToday.pdf">here</a>. I have been plugging the book on Twitter and Facebook in the last few days because as I have been reading through it, I have come to realise how important of a book it is. If you consider yourself to be an adherent of the Reformed tradition, this book should be required reading. Bolt does an excellent job of summarising the tradition and demonstrating it to be a holistic worldview, not just a soteriological perspective. The recent resurgence in Reformed theology, specifically amongst the so-called New Calvinists, has led many to adopt the label of 'Reformed' without understanding the fullness and breadth of the tradition. Reformed theology, Bolt argues, is about a lot more than the redemption of our souls.</p>

I may post more on this as I continue to read. Since we are in the middle of traveling and moving right now, I was not sure I would get the time to do so, but it seems I might. Stay tuned for more. In the meantime, be sure to download and read Bolt's book, and spread the word. With the increasing number of people claiming to be Reformed, this is becoming especially important.
