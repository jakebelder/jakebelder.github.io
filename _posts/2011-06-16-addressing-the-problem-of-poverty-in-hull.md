<p>When we arrive in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston-Upon-Hull">Hull</a> in July, one of the projects I will be working on is a programme that <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/">St John's</a> has begun to set up to <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/cap.htm">help people in Hull deal with the problem of debt</a>. The unemployment rate in Hull is very high, as is the number of people who fall below the poverty line. There is a lot of work to be done on this front.</p>
<p>Melvin Tinker, the vicar at St John's, pointed me to this video yesterday. It gives a good picture of the situation in Hull and talks about some of the encouraging initiatives that have been started to address the problems there. The video is a promotion for <a href="http://www.cuf.org.uk/act/poverty-sunday">Poverty Sunday</a>, to make people aware both of the need and of how they can support efforts to alleviate poverty in Hull. You can find out more about the <a href="http://www.cuf.org.uk">Church Urban Fund by visiting their website</a>.</p>
