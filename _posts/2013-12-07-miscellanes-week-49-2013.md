Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 300px; height: 345px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Advent-candle.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>01-07 December 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18V1WQ0">Expect Glory</a></strong> – I really enjoyed this post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager</a>, who writes that when churches gather together, it ought to really feel natural and like a family, but that we also should expect real transformation will come out of that.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gATYgE">The Advent Project</a></strong> – This online Advent calendar has been put together by <a href="http://ccca.biola.edu/">Biola University's Center for Christianity, Culture and the Arts</a>, and looks like a great resource. It is very well done and very creative.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18dXWte">The six points of Calvinism</a></strong> – Someone thought it would be fun to distil the so-called 'five points of Calvinism', commonly abbreviated 'TULIP', by using the acronym 'CALVIN' instead. All I can say is that it's time to stop with the acronyms – and far more importantly, it's time to stop defining and reducing Calvinism to a soteriological system.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/187Dzjx">Book Review: In Search of Deep Faith</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland">Tim Høiland</a> has a great review of <a href="http://twitter.com/JimBelcher">Jim Belcher's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830837744/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0830837744&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21"><em>In Search of Deep Faith</em></a>, which is part autobiography and part biography of some of Belcher's spiritual heroes, and an exploration of how to avoid falling into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralistic_therapeutic_deism">moralistic, therapeutic deism</a> by cultivating a vibrant, living, and consequential faith. I've added this one to my wishlist.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/190zVqb">Does God’s Presence Go Missing?</a></strong> – In this helpful post, <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a> discusses why we need to be more careful when we talk about God's presence with his people. Our language, though perhaps not intentionally, can convey the idea that God is not always present with us, something which Pentecost has so clearly rendered false. God is <em>always</em> with his people.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eSMUe1">Liberty What Crimes Are Committed In Thy Name?</a></strong> – The influence of Enlightenment thought has put the idea in our minds that our sin is really of little or no consequence if it doesn't affect others. <a href="http://www.oakhill.ac.uk/teaching_staff/mike_ovey.html">Mike Ovey</a> debunks that idea in this helpful article in part by suggesting that we understand sin as 'theft' rather than 'rebellion.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iFldeh">What the Fa la la la is Advent?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/KnowTea">John Allen Bankson</a> has written a book on what Advent is all about, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1937063844/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1937063844&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21"><em>Rekindling Advent: Rediscovering the Season of Joyful Waiting</em></a>, and here's a good interview with him discussing the book and why Advent is such an important time for the church.</li>
