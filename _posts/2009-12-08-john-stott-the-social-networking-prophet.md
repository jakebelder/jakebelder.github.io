<p>Earlier today I found a nice used copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott">John Stott's</a> book on preaching, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Worlds-Challenge-Preaching/dp/0802806279/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260314487&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Between Tw</span><span style="font-style: italic;">o Worlds</span></a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>(which now, somewhat ironically, sits right beside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_Lloyd-Jones">Martyn Lloyd-Jones'</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Preaching-Preachers-D-Martyn-Lloyd-Jones/dp/0310278708/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260314522&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Preaching and Preachers</span></a>, on the bookshelf). I opened the book at random to page 69, where I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
It is difficult to imagine the world in the year A.D. 2000, by which time versatile micro-processors are likely to be as common as simple calculators are today. We should certainly welcome the fact that the silicon chip will transcend human brain-power, as the machine has transcended human muscle-power. Much less welcome will be the probable reduction of human contact as the new electronic network renders personal relationships ever less necessary. In such a dehumanized society the fellowship of the local church will become increasingly important, whose members meet one another, and talk and listen to one another in person rather than on screen. In this human context of mutual love the speaking and hearing of the Word of God is also likely to become more necessary for the preservation of our humanness, not less.
</blockquote>
<p>I guess he was off by a few years, as the social networking revolution came along a little later than 2000, but he made a pretty fair assessment back in 1982 when the book was published.</p>

What do you make of his call to the local church in response?
