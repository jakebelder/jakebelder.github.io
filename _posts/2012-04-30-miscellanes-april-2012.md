<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted the following Monday. For the sake of ease in moving this blog, however, I've put all of April together in this post.</p>
<p>Below are the links from <strong>April 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=53_qvMQfvOE">A very creative presentation using a number of iPads</a></strong> on why Stockholm is a great city in which to start a business.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.rca.org/Page.aspx?pid=8188">Reading the Catechism Harmonically</a></strong> &ndash; Scott Sherman reflects on finding the seeds of the church's missionary calling in the Heidelberg Catechism.</li>
<li>Here are <strong><a href="http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/index.php?page=Resources2">three short videos</a></strong> from <a href="http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk">Tyndale House</a> on the evidence for Easter and the resurrection (they are at the bottom of the page).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/kneeling-on-naughty-step.html">Kneeling on the naughty step</a></strong> &ndash; <a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk">John Richardson</a> raises an interesting discussion about the place of absolution in the Lord's Supper. He writes, "we receive the bread and wine not as forgiven sinners, but as sinners <em>seeking</em> forgiveness. Confession should be followed by reception, and in that we find our absolution."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/blog/2012/04/sabbath-rest/">Sabbath Rest</a></strong> &ndash; On the <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/blog">Cardus Blog</a>, Kathryn de Ruijter reflects on the practice of keeping the Sabbath, finding it "a life-giving pattern waiting to be rediscovered by a bustling humanity."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.faithandleadership.com/blog/03-26-2012/katie-boone-called-the-mundane">Katie Boone: Called to the mundane</a></strong> &ndash; As I continue to ponder the importance of a biblical of vocation, I found this post on "mundane" work to be helpful. The author writes, "Mundane, repetitive work teaches humility. You are not too good for it."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/?p=2991">Tesco &ndash; now it's mice infestations</a></strong> &ndash; Echoing the sort of theology that views <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/the-tornado-the-lutherans-and-homosexuality">acts of nature as the judgement of God</a>, a group here in the UK called Christian Voice proposes that a recent mice infestation at a Tesco store in London is God's judgement on the supermarket chain for giving &pound;30,000 to Gay Pride.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://theresurgence.com/2012/03/28/10-tips-on-preparing-and-preaching-for-easter">10 Tips on Preparing and Preaching for Easter</a></strong> &ndash; Mark Driscoll had a blog post this past week with tips for Easter services. One of them simply states, "Easter is not a time to get fancy." While this is a point I can fully get behind, you can't help note that it comes from the guy who last year rented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwest_Field">Qwest Field</a> to hold <a href="http://marshill.com/media/easter/easter-2011-qwest-promo-2">Mars Hill's Easter service</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3155/surprising-evidences-of-unity">Surprising Evidences of Unity</a></strong> &ndash; My friend, Brian Dijkema, discusses the how Catholics and Protestants are finding their statements overlapping more and more when it comes to the public witness of Christianity in the modern world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/but-then-is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-christian-college-1/">But then is there such a thing as a Christian college?</a> (<a href="http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/but-then-is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-christian-college-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/but-then-is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-christian-college-2/">Part 2</a>)</strong> &ndash; Nelson Kloosterman has two important posts about a recent attack on Christian education <em>from within</em>, the first highlighting the problematic understanding of common grace in two-kingdom theology; the second, simply concluding that such attacks are "aiding and abetting the enemies of Christian education in this, our rapidly secularizing and paganizing North American culture."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/david-camerons-easter-greeting.html">David Cameron's Easter greeting</a></strong> &ndash; <a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk">Archbishop Cranmer</a> analyses and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking">fisks</a> Cameron's Easter message, then comparing it with Barack Obama's who, considering many American Christians think he is a Muslim, does a pretty good job of sharing the gospel.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-church-broadcasts-services-world/story-15654138-detail/story.html">Hull church broadcasts services to the world</a></strong> &ndash; Our church, <a href="http://www.stjohnnewland.org.uk">St John Newland</a>, was recently featured in the local paper. They did a brief profile of the church and focused on why we livestream our services.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/aprilweb-only/everyday-missions-excerpt.html"><strong>You Don&rsquo;t Have to Quit to Find Life-Giving Work</strong></a> &ndash; There are some helpful thoughts in this excerpt from the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0073W3D4I/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B0073W3D4I"><em>Everyday Missions: How Ordinary People Can Change the World</em></a>, on understanding jobs and callings. While we might not feel our job is our calling, "sometimes our callings may run parallel to the work we call a job."</li>
<li><a href="http://joeljmiller.com/write-in-your-books/"><strong>Write in Your Books</strong></a> &ndash; Here are four very good reasons you should write in your books. It's a regular practice of mine, and I have found it to be very helpful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/family/marriage/divorce-and-remarriage/the-christian-divorce-rate-myth.html"><strong>The Christian Divorce Rate Myth</strong></a> &ndash; I found this article very interesting. If what the article claims is true, that divorce rates among Christians are significantly lower than the average, why are we only every told that the rates are the same?</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/04/10/a-bubba-with-a-passion-for-the-gospel-and-golf-in-that-order/"><strong>A Bubba With a Passion for the Gospel and Golf (In That Order)</strong></a> &ndash; I honestly don't understand why evangelicals make such a big deal about professional athletes who are Christians. <strong></strong>Does it provide some sort of justification for their idolatry? Why don't they equally celebrate the work of faithful Christians in other spheres of life?</li>
<li><strong></strong><a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/what-does-it-mean-to-be-evangelical/"><strong>What does it mean to be evangelical?</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk">Phil Whittall</a> hosts an interesting conversation on this question on his blog. It's a question that many people ask, because often it feels as if the term is undefinable. What are the parameters and boundaries within one must fall in order to be considered an evangelical? I'm not entirely sure myself.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDXuCE7LeQ">Old Man In Nursing Home Reacts To Hearing Music From His Era</a></strong> &ndash; This video has been making the rounds this week, and for good reason. It's a wonderful demonstration of the power of music. What a good gift God has woven into the fabric of creation.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/so-its-obama-versus-romney-and-romney.html"><strong>So, it&rsquo;s Obama versus Romney. And Romney will lose.</strong></a> &ndash; I'm not much for politics, but <a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/">His Grace</a> is right about this. Obama is almost certain to win another term now.</li>
<li><a href="http://marshill.com/2012/04/10/is-your-church-interested-in-becoming-a-part-of-mars-hill"><strong>Is Your Church Interested in Becoming a Part of Mars Hill?</strong></a> &ndash; Someone on Facebook aptly called this 'corporate takeover.' There are so many things wrong with this seemingly gracious and charitable offer from Mars Hill Church in Seattle. Not least is the implicit assertion that if your church is smaller than 1000 members, you're doing something wrong. What's more, you're leadership team will likely get the axe and most of the preaching will be piped in via video. If your pastor is good enough, though, he'll be invited to leave his current position and join the team at corporate headquarters.</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2012/04/garber/"><strong>Weaving together belief and behavior</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://tjhoiland.com">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> has just finished reading Steven Garber's excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830833196/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0830833196"><em>The Fabric of Faithfulness</em></a>, and discusses why the university years are so crucial for the formation of a coherent worldview that connects belief and behaviour.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://the12.squarespace.com/james-ka-smith/2012/3/27/kings-creeds-and-the-canon-musing-on-nt-wright.html">Kings, Creed, and Canon: Musing on N.T. Wright</a></strong> &ndash; A few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">James K.A. Smith</a> posted some thoughts on <a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/">Tom Wright's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006QB98NC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B006QB98NC"><em>How God Became King</em></a>, and it was quite a surprise to discover this week that Wright has left a number of comments on the post interacting with some of Smith's (and a few of the other commenters) thoughts.<a class="url" rel="external nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/IBAQj9" target="_blank"></a> It's an interesting discussion.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/dutyanddesire.html?paging=off"><strong>Duty and Desire: The Best Hope for Our Children's Education</strong></a> &ndash; Steven Garber discusses what constitutes the best hope for a good education and a good life, and concludes, "It is not only important that our children learn their <em>duty</em> to love God and his world, but that they learn to <em>desire</em> that."</li>
<li><a href="http://trevormcmaken.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/john-stott-the-napper/"><strong>John Stott, the Napper</strong></a> &ndash; Stott's daily schedule included a short nap because of the benefits it offered in terms of alertness and focus. This past week I made an effort to fit in a 20-minute nap almost every day, and it really did wonders to help get over the post-lunch slump.</li>
<li><a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/could-lay-celebration-renew-church-of.html"><strong>Could lay celebration renew the Church of England?</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/">John Richardson</a> has a very interesting discussion on his blog about lay leadership in the church, particularly at Holy Communion. I grew up in a context where only ordained ministers were permitted to preside at Communion, but am now in a context where the notion of lay presidency is more accepted. I'm not really sure where I stand on the matter, and plan to spend some time studying the matter in the near future. <em>(<strong>Update: </strong>John has <a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/lay-celebration-integrating-our-word.html">blogged a response</a> to his first post with some further biblical and theological reflection on the issue).</em><strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/7541467/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-rebukes-claims-of-persecuted-Christians-in-UK.html"><strong>Archbishop of Canterbury rebukes claims of 'persecuted' Christians in UK</strong></a> &ndash; Rowan Williams is right to say we need to keep our ideas of persecution against Christians in perspective. Most of us in the West can't rightfully speak of being 'persecuted'. That we face some opposition is certainly true, but isn't the Bible clear that Christians should expect this for their faithfulness to Christ?</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2012/04/creation-regained/"><strong>Al Wolters on worldview in everyday life</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://tjhoiland.com/">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> has been reading some good books lately, including Al Wolters' excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802829694/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802829694"><em>Creation Regained</em></a>. Here he gives a helpful review of the book, hitting on its main points and drawing out the importance of a biblical worldview. Read Tim's review, and then buy the book and read it for yourself.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://markrglanville.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/why-skeptics-need-easter-sunday/">Why skeptics need Easter Sunday</a></strong> &ndash; Mark Glanville writes, "There is surely something wrong with a worldview that has nothing to say about our death." Indeed, the only hope the world has is in the risen Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><a href="http://willimon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/following-jesus-after-easter.html"><strong>Following Jesus After Easter</strong></a> &ndash; Also on Easter, William Willimon reflects on a conversation he once had with a man who recognised that "if it&rsquo;s true that Jesus is really real, I'd have to change my whole life." This is the challenge we all face as we encounter the risen Christ.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2012/04/children_s_memories_toddlers_remember_better_than_you_think_.single.html"><strong>I Remember Mama and Dada</strong></a> &ndash; New research now tells us that children remember far more than we think. As I read this, I immediately thought that this is all the more reason to keep children in worship instead of taking them out of the worshipping community during their formative years. I may return to this in a future post.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dordt.edu/cgi-bin/news/get_news.pl?id=5661"><strong>Latest book from Dordt Press details Abraham Kuyper's visit to U.S.</strong></a> &ndash; While on a trip to the United States, Kuyper wrote letters back to his family, which has been gathered in this collection. It looks like it will be a very interesting read.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/942/making-the-most-of-college-recovering-the-lost-logic-of-church"><strong>Making the most of college: Recovering the lost logic of church</strong></a> &ndash; This is a great article on the importance of nurturing faith during the university years, particularly focusing on the necessity of belonging to a worshipping community throughout this formative time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.extremelysmart.com/humor/stopsign"><strong>The Hermeneutics of the Stop Sign</strong></a> &ndash; Whoever put this together was quite clever. I never thought it was possible to interpret a stop sign in so many different ways.</li>
<li><a href="http://whatyouthinkmatters.org/blog/article/twelve-reasons-to-move-to-cities-and-why-ten-of-them-need-rethinking"><strong>Twelve Reasons to Move to Cities (and Why Eleven of them Need Rethinking)</strong></a> &ndash; We hear all the time how important cities are and why the church needs to focus on them, and I've long thought that to be true. But I've also thought that there is an undue emphasis placed on the city, and it's good to know I'm not the only one. There are some thought-provoking things in this article, especially from a UK perspective.</li>
<li><a href="http://davidkeen.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/books-of-bible.html"><strong>Books of the Bible: the Baby Name Remix</strong></a> &ndash; This is quite amusing.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/04/18/three-arguments-for-weekly-communion/"><strong>Three Arguments for Weekly Communion</strong></a> &ndash; In the past few years, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/tag/eucharist">the subject of the the Lord's Supper has come up a number of times</a> on this blog, and I have stated a few times that I think it ought to be a weekly practice in the church. The three reasons the author of this article suggests we ought to practice weekly communion nicely sums up my own thinking on the matter.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><a href="http://theamericanjesus.net/?p=6556"><strong>Taking A Sabbatical From Church</strong></a> &ndash; I am only linking to this article here, but it frustrated me so much that I might do a full post on the myriad of things wrong with it, particularly the poor use of biblical evidence to support an argument that seems to be based on self-righteousness more than anything else.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.altervideomagazine.com/2012/04/18/mending-furniture-saving-lives/"><strong>Mending Furniture and Saving Lives</strong></a> &ndash; The folks at <a href="http://www.altervideomagazine.com/">Alter Video Magazine</a> have put together a short video of Tom Wright talking about examples of the gospel at work in the lives of people. It's a wonderful testament to the simple ways the gospel transforms people and communities.</li>
<li><a href="http://nearemmaus.com/2012/04/19/the-ten-most-difficult-doctrinaltheological-subjects-that-contemporary-christians-must-address/"><strong>The ten most difficult doctrinal/theological subjects that contemporary Christians must address</strong></a> &ndash; This is quite an interesting list, and certainly many of them are spot on. What would you add or take away from the list?</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/parts-of-book-explained.html">The parts of a book explained</a></strong> &ndash;&nbsp; <a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.co.uk/">Steve Bishop</a> posts a video in which someone from <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk">Abe Books</a> explains more than you ever thought you would know about the construction of a book.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thehighcalling.org/culture/everything-matters-teaching-cultural-act"><strong>Everything Matters: Teaching as a Cultural Act</strong></a> &ndash; David Naugle writes in this great article, "teaching matters because it is a cultural act. As a teacher, I help  students become what God intended them to be as His image and likeness:  culture-makers!"</li>
<li><a href="http://kudospress.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/104-John-Stott-and-Sermon-Preparation.html"><strong>John Stott and Sermon Preparation</strong></a> &ndash; Someone found an old cassette tape with a recording of a talk Stott gave in 1977 on the subject of sermon preparation and has made it available as an mp3. I haven't listened to it yet, but this is bound to be very interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://krishk.com/2012/04/preaching-bible-book-sermon/"><strong>Preaching a Whole Bible Book in One Sermon</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.krishk.com">Krish Kandiah</a> says that since you won't preach through every book of the Bible throughout the course of your ministry, it's worth tackling a whole book in a sermon once in a while, and he provides some helpful tips for how you might approach such a sermon.</li>
