I just finished John Frame's introduction to systematic theology, *Salvation Belongs to the Lord*, and his final few pages deal with how we make all this theology apply to everyday life. One of the reviews on the back of book says that Frame's theology is "sweetly pastoral", and after reading this, I would completely agree. What has been so welcoming about his book is the fact it makes theology real and accessible. I found his thoughts on how to do this particularly important and enlightening:

<blockquote>
Theology is the application of the Word to all areas of life. God hasn't given us His precious Word so that we should just carry it around in our heads. And he certainly hasn't given it to us so to that we can boast to others of how much we know and look down on them because they haven't had the opportunity God has given us...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
God wants you to know his word...know it so well that it is at the tip of your tongue, so that you can use it to comfort or challenge somebody in need. This is the Great Commission, of course, and that is what we are about. That is why we are on earth...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
God wants his Word written on your heart. That is the heart of the new covenant in Jeremiah 31, that God will write his Word not on tables of stone but on the fleshy tables of our hearts. That means that the Word of God is so intimately fixed in our inmost being that God's desires are our desires, that his commands are our wishes, that we deeply want to be what he wants us to be. Don't be satisfied, then, with what seems to be an adequate concept of biblical doctrine. Keep asking how that doctrine should change you. Ask what sins of your heart God is rebuking, what righteous choices he wants you to embrace. Don't have the attitude of wanting to defend the status quo in your life or in the church. God gave us the Bible to bring changes in us, and he isn't finished doing that yet" (341-342).
</blockquote>

I think that last little bit could have implications for my posts of Orthodoxy and postmodernism a few days back. But at any rate, these are welcome words. They are words to keep in mind if you theologize either academically or from your armchair. What we learn is not supposed to remain in our minds, but is supposed to change us, make us grow, stretch us, empower us, and guide us. As Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." These words are true indeed. Let the Word of God dwell in your heart. Don't just love it, *live* it.
