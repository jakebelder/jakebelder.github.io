Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>20-26 October 2013</strong>.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/170Ketk">Faithful to the end: An interview with Eugene Peterson</a></strong> – Here is an interview with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_H._Peterson">Eugene Peterson</a> reflecting on his many years in ministry. It's good to hear a bit more about the background of a man whose writing I have been really blessed by.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/19kiTC0">The Megachurch & Social Architecture: Realities & Questions</a></strong> – This is a really interesting piece on the nature of megachurches and their place within society, and particularly American society.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ayc25U">Welby backs GAFCON vision for a renewed Anglican Church</a></strong> – This week has seen the second <a href="http://gafcon.org/conferences/nairobi-2013">Global Anglican Future Conference</a> meeting in Nairobi, Kenya (the photo above is the official photo of the bishops and archbishops). The relationship of the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://twitter.com/ABCJustin">Justin Welby</a>, to the conference has proven to be interesting. Here he acknowledges the reform needed across the Anglican Communion and offers something of his support to the delegates.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Hf8Owj">Why Study Theology</a></strong> – Here is a great little video clip from <a href="http://twitter.com/mbird12">Michael Bird</a> on the importance of studying theology.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1afhWvV">Whither Gafcon II?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/geoconger">George Conger</a>, in this excellent piece, writes that GAFCON must answer some big questions about its identity and direction for the future if the movement is going to go forward. This is a critical time for the group, because inaction on the back of this conference might spell the end of the movement.</li>

<li><strong>GAFCON 2013 resources</strong> – Here are a bunch of resources following GAFCON for those who weren't able to be there:<br>
