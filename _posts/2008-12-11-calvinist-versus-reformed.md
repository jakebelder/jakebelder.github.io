[Anthony Bradley has an insightful post](http://bradley.chattablogs.com/archives/2008/12/calvinistic-but.html) exploring the differences between Calvinist and Reformed people, bringing to light the fact that they are not synonymous terms, despite being commonly perceived as such. He says,

<blockquote>
There are many folks with Calvinist views of sin and salvation (T.U.L.I.P.--God-sin-Christ-faith) but are void of a Reformed view of creation and culture (creation-fall-redemption-consummation)...The confessional, doctrinalist, and highly pietist old southern denominational tradition with its emphasis on the church as an alternative community and an escape from culture may explain why missionally minded Reformed folks do not find a reference point in those circles...You can fully embrace T.U.L.I.P. and reduce Christianity to individualistic personal piety, withdrawal from culture with a false sacred/secular distinction, confuse the Kingdom with the church, be void of a doctrine of creation, etc.
</blockquote>

This is an important distinction to make, I think, and helped me to put my finger on why I occasionally feel out of place among the most conservative of Calvinists, even though I subscribe to most of the same doctrines they do. There is a lot more to say on this (perhaps it can be the subject of another series). For now, go and read the rest of Anthony's post [here](http://bradley.chattablogs.com/archives/2008/12/calvinistic-but.html).
