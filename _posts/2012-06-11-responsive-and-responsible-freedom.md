<p>One of the books I have been enjoying a great deal recently is <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/spykman.htm" target="_blank">Gordon Spykman's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802805256/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802805256" target="_blank"><em>Reformational Theology: A New Paradigm for Doing Dogmatics</em></a>. It's expensive, but worth getting if you can (used copies are more decently priced). Spykman does a particularly good job at exposing the latent dualism in many treatments of theology, and works out his theology within the framework of the creation-fall-redemption narrative of Scripture. It makes for quite interesting and thought-provoking reading.</p>
<p>In his chapter on anthropology, Spykman devotes some space to the question of human freedom, particularly with reference to the responsibilities God has entrusted to mankind. How are we to understand&nbsp; freedom in the context of responsibility? I found these comments particularly helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
Ours is not an initiating but a responsive and responsible freedom. We are responsible <em>to</em> God and responsible <em>for</em> his other creatures, accountable <em>to</em> our Maker <em>for</em> his cosmos. This understanding of human freedom, grounded in creation and illumined by the Scriptures, is far removed from the modern secularized version of freedom, the pretended autonomy of human reason. For true freedom rests on willing submission to the Word of God, not emancipation from it... This biblical perspective excludes the so-called freedom of contrary choice, as though man is fully free only when he is equally disposed toward good and evil, as though he possesses an open choice between right and wrong. Such freedom has never existed, not even in Adam, and certainly not since then. A presumed freedom of contrary choice is foreign to God's good creation. For to choose evil is not freedom but bondage. By divine design we are never free to disobey. Obedience to God's Word is the only open door to a liberated and liberating life.
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions of human freedom tend to begin with and centre on humanity, but this helpfully situates the issue in the context of God's sovereignty and his covenant relationship with us. My friend and colleague, <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/lee.htm" target="_blank">Lee McMunn</a>, who created and presents the recently published <a href="http://www.identitycourse.com" target="_blank">Identity Course</a>, illustrates this biblical idea of freedom very helpfully with the analogy of a landlord and tenant (<a href="http://www.identitycourse.com/play.asp?ix=4&amp;media=english/2_talk" target="_blank">click here</a> and fast forward to about 13:07 to hear it).</p>

It is, of course, something of a paradox that true freedom is submission to God. But just as something like a toaster or a lawnmower works best when it is used in the way the designers intended, so we find the fullness of life when we live in the way our Creator intended, faithfully carrying out all the responsibilities he has entrusted to us.
