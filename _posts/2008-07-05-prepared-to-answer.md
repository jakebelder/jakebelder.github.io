<p>Although I have not given a great deal of attention to apologetics, this morning, as I prepare to launch our adult Sunday School program at church into a study of Tim Keller's book, <a href="http://www.thereasonforgod.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reason for God</span></a>, I am reminded of the words of 1 Peter 3:15: "Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have."</p>
<p>We sometimes need a reality check to remind us of one of the most prominent reasons we remain on this earth.  And that reason is found in the words of the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2028:16-20;&amp;version=31;">Great Commission</a>, where Jesus instructs us to go and make disciples of all nations.  To make disciples we need to be prepared to teach and mentor them, and to teach requires knowledge.  Our faith is not just assent to a number of propositions, but requires a living and vital knowledge of why we believe what we believe.  There needs to be reasons for our belief, and only in exploring those reasons will be prepared to give an answer to those who demand answers from us.  Keller says,</p>

<blockquote>
People who blithely go through life too busy or indifferent to ask hard questions about why they believe as they do will find themselves defenseless against either the experience of tragedy or the probing questions of a smart skeptic...It is no longer sufficient to hold beliefs just because you inherited them.  Only if you struggle long and hard with objections to your faith will you be able to provide grounds for you beliefs to skeptics, including yourself, that are plausible rather than ridiculous or offensive (xvi-xvii).
</blockquote>

This, I would argue, is one of the reasons for good theological training. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/train-up-a-child"> I have said in the past</a> that I believe it is the responsibility of every church to ensure that its members are instructed in the matters of faith and theology.  Faith cannot be a disinterested confession.  A knowledge of the tenants of our faith will equip us not only to fulfill our obligation to those who demand answers from us, but will enable us to live more fully for the One who gave us that faith.
