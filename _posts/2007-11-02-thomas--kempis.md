Thomas à Kempis, from *de imitatione Christi*, I, 1-2:

<blockquote>
If you knew the whole Bible by heart, along with all the definitions of the philosophers, what good would this be without grace and love? 'Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity' (Ecclesiastes 1:2)--except, that is, loving God and serving God alone. For this is the supreme wisdom: to draw nearer to the heavenly kingdom through contempt for the world...what use is knowledge without the fear of God?
</blockquote>
