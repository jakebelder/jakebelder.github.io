<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>10-16 February 2013</strong>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://wesleyhill.tumblr.com/post/42667183605/in-recent-years-the-mainline-churches-have-become">Fleming Rutledge on the weaknesses of the lectionary</a></strong> - This is an interesting quote on the drawbacks of using a lectionary. Particularly notable is Rutledge's suggestion that it fosters biblical illiteracy. Though I think there are pros and cons to either side of the lectionary question, his points here are food for thought.</li>
<li><a href="http://rgrydns2.blogspot.ca/2013/02/introduction-to-christian-doctrine-101.html" target="_blank"><strong>Intro to Christian Doctrine 101</strong></a> - Here is an intriguing post from <a href="http://twitter.com/rgrydns" target="_blank">Richard Greydanus</a> on the best place to begin an examination of Christianity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2013/02/i-confess-part-ii.php" target="_blank"><strong>I Confess (Part II)</strong></a> - <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html" target="_blank">Carl Trueman</a> continues his series on the benefits of a confessional church, and here argues that a confession helps to restrain pastoral tyranny and creates necessary boundaries for the well-being of the church.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2013/02/13/3689782.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Does the Anglican Church really need a new Theologian-in-Chief?</strong></a> - Rowan Williams was known for being a serious thinker and academic, but Justin Welby is a different character. <a href="http://twitter.com/TheosElizabeth" target="_blank">Elizabeth Oldfield</a> asks whether it is necessary for an archbishop to be something like a theologian-in-chief, and suggests that this is perhaps not their main role.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2013/02/13/why-bother-with-lent/" target="_blank"><strong>Why Bother with Lent?</strong></a> - Although in the past most evangelicals haven't paid any attention to the church calendar, it is becoming more popular of late to do so. This includes observing seasons like Lent. Because of this, there have been some helpful pieces going around on what Lent is actually all about, including this one.</li>
<li><a href="http://frjohnpeck.com/youth-ministry-the-50-year-failed-experiment/" target="_blank"><strong>Youth Ministry &ndash; The 50 Year Failed Experiment</strong></a> - This post has been making the rounds, and there is certainly some really thought-provoking stuff here. It is important that we keep questioning the assumptions that 'youth ministry', popularly conceived, is the way to keep young people in the church. The reality is that, in many cases, it's doing the exact opposite.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/detroit/covenant-community-care.html?paging=off&amp;buffer_share=1c828&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>The Great Physicians of Detroit</strong></a> - Here is yet another encouraging story from <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> of Christians seeking to bless their city. In this story, it's about a group of Christians who are providing low- or no-cost healthcare to the vulnerable in their community. This is such a massive need in America, and it would be wonderful to see more Christians around the country doing this.</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/friday-fun-35-restoring-the-art-of-acquaintance-making/" target="_blank"><strong>Restoring the art of acquaintance-making</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> has a helpful post on his blog on how to have a conversation. You might laugh and wonder why someone needs to write something about this, but the reality is that conversation-making is a lost art, and few people know how to do it anymore.</li>
