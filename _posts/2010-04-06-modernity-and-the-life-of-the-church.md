<p>For quite some time now I have been eyeing the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Where-God-Lives-Doctrine/dp/0802845827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270499593&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The House Where God Lives: The Doctrine of the Church</em></a>, written by Gary D. Badcock, a professor at <a href="http://www.huronuc.ca/faculty_of_theology/faculty_members/">Huron University College</a> in London, Ontario. It has been on the shelf at the seminary's bookstore, but at nearly $27.00 (for a paperback!), the pricetag is rather steep and has kept me from purchasing it. It is unfortunate, because the bits I have read from it are good.</p>
<p>One of the chapters in the book focuses on the relationship of the Church and modernity, a discussion in which Badcock largely employs the critique of <a href="http://www.divinity.duke.edu/portal_memberdata/rhuetter">Reinhard H&uuml;tter</a>, professor of theology at Duke Divinity School. About a decade ago, H&uuml;tter published a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Suffering-Divine-Things-Theology-Practice/dp/0802846882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270504661&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Suffering Divine Things</em></a>, where he argued that "the church in the cultural context of modernity faces a distinct and massive problem." Badcock continues:</p>
<blockquote>
In the classical Christian tradition, the church was acknowledged as the setting in which it is uniquely possible to come to know God as the one who draws us into relationship with himself through the crucified Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit. By contrast, the historical path taken by the church in modernity has emptied it of this foundational theological confidence. We find ourselves in a situation so fundamentally shaped by modernity and its doctrine of the free individual that the individual subject now stands even at the center of what passes for ecclesiology. Instead of the church appearing as the context in which we are shaped by the Word and Spirit of God, the church is here reduced to rendering functional service to the modern doctrine of the individual. Under the conditions of modernity, H&uuml;tter maintains, the individual has become the 'end of the church'.<br><br>

While the church's service to modernity in this respect might have made it culturally 'relevant' in a certain narrow sense, when viewed from the standpoint of the doctrine of the church as a strictly theological theme, the result is clearly problematic. The problem can be seen in several sectors of church life: on the one hand, in 'the service-jargon pervasive in contemporary church growth talk,' in which the market reigns supreme and the gospel must do it homage, or on the other, in something even worse&mdash;though it is, to be sure, a function of the same pressures&mdash;'the kind of free metaphorical constructivism characterizing especially North American Protestant theology in its more progressive representatives'.<br><br>

H&uuml;tter maintains that what is missing from such approaches is any clear commitment to the church as locus of the distinct practices of the proclamation of the Word of the gospel of grace and the celebration of the sacraments, by which alone the triune God of the Christian revelation can be known, obeyed, and enjoyed. In H&uuml;tter's judgment, the importance of these practices has been generally belittled under the influences of modernity, as the religious experience of the individual has instead been refashioned and mediated by other means. The consequence is the pervasive spiritual and theological impoverishment of the church, which lives by the Word and sacrament or not at all (291-292).
</blockquote>
<p>A forceful critique, to be sure, but an accurate one. And nowhere is this more evident, perhaps, than within the context of the American church, which has been largely shaped by modernity and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-driving-force-in-american-christianity">driven  by the notion of individual freedom</a> since its founding. It is unfortunate that critiques like this need to be made, but the "spiritual and theological impoverishment" that Badcock speaks of is a palpable reality in the modern church because it has sought, even if not intentionally, to find its source of life apart from Christ.</p>

The life of the church is always and only Christ. We share in Christ and all his blessings by faith, and that faith is produced in us by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the Word and in the sacraments (<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_sacraments.cfm">Heidelberg Catechism, Q&amp;A 65</a>). When these are lost, the very life of the church is in peril.
