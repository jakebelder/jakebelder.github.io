There is a little town in western Ontario called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley,_Ontario">Chesley</a>. It's largely a farming community and I likely would not have even heard of it except that I have relatives living just outside of it. Recently, I learned something interesting about the town. It houses a small, <a href="http://www.presbyterianreformed.org/">Presbyterian Reformed</a> church, which would be  rather inconsequential if not for one peculiar claim to fame.

If you are into Reformed theology, you will likely be familiar with the name of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray_%28theologian%29">John Murray</a>, the noted systematic theologian who taught at <a href="http://www.wts.edu/">Westminster Theological Seminary</a> for many years. Murray was good friends with William Matheson, who was the pastor of the church in Chesley around the same time Murray taught at Westminster. Their friendship had been solidified during a controversy in the Free Presbyterian Church years earlier. Murray would often travel to Chesley to visit Matheson and preached in the church on quite a number of occasions, especially after Matheson died in 1957. In fact, Murray would say of the church, &ldquo;I think I feel most at home here and at Chesley of all the places I visit.&rdquo; You can read more of the story of the church <a href="http://www.presbyterianreformed.org/ourhistory.php">here</a>.

Perhaps this is only of interest to me, but I thought it was worth sharing. My relatives might be interested to know that their little town has a small place in Reformed history.

Incidentally, the photo of the 14th concession on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley,_Ontario">Wikipedia page for Chesley</a> is taken by my dad. My grandparents live just over the rise on the right side.
