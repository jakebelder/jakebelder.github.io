<p>As I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desiring-Kingdom-Worldview-Formation-Liturgies/dp/0801035775"><span style="font-style: italic;">Desiring the Kingdom</span></a>, author <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">Jamie Smith</a> has continued to provoke me to thought with his insights. Earlier, <a href="http://www.jakebelder.com/2009/10/what-is-education-all-about.html">I quoted a portion of the introduction</a>, which had pointed to some of the questions he was setting out to answer in the book. On page 68, Smith speaks briefly about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_%28philosopher%29">Charles Taylor's</a> notion of the "social imaginary" (discussed in Taylor's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secular-Age-Charles-Taylor/dp/0674026764"><span style="font-style: italic;">A Secular Age</span></a>), and then talks about how that notion can help the Christian worldview conversation. In many ways, I think this portion directly addresses some of his earlier questions.</p>

<blockquote>
The 'social imaginary' is an affective, noncognitive understanding of the world. It is described as an <span style="font-style: italic;">imaginary</span> (rather than a <span style="font-style: italic;">theory</span>) because it is fueled by the stuff of the imagination rather than the intellect: it is made up of, and embedded in, stories, narratives, myths, and icons. These visions capture our hearts and imaginations by 'lining' our imagination, as it were&mdash;providing us with frameworks of 'meaning' by which we make sense of our world and our calling in it. An irreducible understanding of the world resides in our intuitive, precognitive grasp of these stories.<br /><br />

Now, what does this have to do with a Christian worldview? I suggest that instead of thinking about worldview as a distinctly Christian 'knowledge,' we should talk about a Christian 'social imaginary' that constitutes a distinctly Christian understanding of the world that is implicit in the practices of Christian worship. Discipleship and formation are less about erecting an edifice of Christian knowledge than they are a matter of developing a Christian know-how that intuitively 'understands' the world in the light of the fullness of the gospel. And insofar as an understanding is implicit in practice, the practices of Christian worship are crucial&mdash;the sine qua non&mdash;for developing a distinctly Christian understanding of the world. The practices of Christian worship are the analogue of biking around the neighborhood, absorbing an understanding of our environment that is precognitive and becomes inscribed in our adaptive unconscious.</blockquote>

What Smith means with the analogy of biking around the neighborhood is that when we live somewhere, we become intimately familiar with it such that we can make our way around it and to specific destinations without even really thinking about where we are going. Another analogy could be the unconscious way we operate a car with a manual transmission after years of doing it.<br /><br />Smith's caution against the concept of worldview becoming too intellectual is one I am familiar with, and I think is helpful. The <span style="font-style: italic;">aim</span> of worldview education is the transformation of the whole person; however, there is a tendency for it to get bogged down in thought and conversation. Smith is entirely right to recognize that worship (not just our public worship on Sunday) plays an integral part&mdash;in fact, it may even be <span style="font-style: italic;">the </span>crucial part&mdash;in forming an holistic understanding of the world.

We must look at the world through the lenses of the gospel, and that begins when our hearts are rightly ordered. What we worship shapes our hearts, dictates what we love, and fosters that intuitive know-how we operate from as we make our way through the world. That Smith should point out how important it is that education be aware of this is not surprising.
