It is important when reading the Bible to understand it as a story, or narrative. Doing so helps us avoid pitfalls like seeing Scripture as a collection of isolated events, or thinking there is a sharp division between the Old and New Testaments. This short video below is a creative look at the story of the Bible in five acts, and though I would quibble a bit with some of the phrasing, on the whole it's a helpful summary of the story of Scripture.
