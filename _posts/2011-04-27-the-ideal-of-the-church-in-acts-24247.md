<p><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ac2.42-47">Acts 2:42-47</a> is a favourite passage of those who like to talk about an ideal of what the church should be like, and for good reason &ndash; we have in these few verses one of the clearest biblical pictures of a vibrant, living, and active church. Mike Goheen and Craig Bartholomew, in their book, <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/3687/nm/Drama+of+Scripture%3A+Finding+Our+Place+in+the+Biblical+Story?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">The Drama of Scripture</a></em>, discuss the marks of the early church in this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
As Luke describes the young church, it has three defining qualities. The first is <em>devotion</em>: this new community devotes itself to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, the breaking of bread, and prayer so that they might more and more experience the life of the kingdom (2:42). The church's second defining quality is that <em>the life of Christ in manifested</em> both in the lives of individual members and in the life of the community considered as a whole. The church is thus known by convincing signs of God's saving power within it (2:43), by justice and mercy in its communal relations (2:44-45), by joyful conviviality (2:46), and by worship (2:47). Third, as the liberating life of the kingdom becomes more and more evident in the church, we hear that the exalted Lord "[adds] to their number daily those who are being saved" (2:47). This too fulfills the Old Testament prophecies about God's kingdom. The prophets pictures the drawing power of a renewed Israel (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Is60.2-3">Isaiah 60:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Zec8.20-23">Zechariah 8:20-23</a>): "A decisive element of the prophetic conception of the pilgrimage of the nations to Zion is that the Gentiles, fascinated by the salvation visible in Israel, are driven of their own accord to the people of God. They do not become believers as a result of missionary activity; rather, the fascination emitted by the people of God draws them close." This newly formed community of the early church is <em>attractive</em> to outsiders. The life of the believing community radiates the light of the kingdom and thus draws people from darkness (cf. <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Eph5.8">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/1Pe2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a>).
</blockquote>

We have here a church which understands that the gospel is about more than just saving souls, and is more than just a belief one needs to hold in order to guarantee eternal life. The gospel is an announcement that in the person of Jesus Christ, the Kingdom of God has come. The gospel calls people to be members of this Kingdom, to serve King Jesus, and to have their whole beings transformed by the power of the risen Christ. The church, believing this message, begins to embody a new reality that testifies in word and bears witness in deed to the rule and lordship of Christ over all of creation. By its words and deeds the church then invites people to an encounter with the Kingdom of God and the true freedom, justice, and peace that comes through the rule of the sovereign Lord, in order that they too might confess that Jesus is Lord and be baptised into this new life.
