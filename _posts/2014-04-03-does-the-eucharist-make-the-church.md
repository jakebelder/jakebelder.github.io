Any discussion of the Eucharist necessarily involves a discussion of symbolism, and particularly about the relationship of the bread and wine to the reality they symbolise. In his book, *[Heavenly Participation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802865429/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0802865429&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, [Hans Boersma](http://www.regent-college.edu/faculty/full-time/hans-boersma) discusses [Augustine’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) understanding of the symbolism of the bread and wine, and the ecclesiological significance of partaking of the Eucharist:

<blockquote>
One of the most interesting lines in [Augustine’s] <a href="http://david.heitzman.net/sermons227-229a.html">Sermon 227</a> says the following about consuming Christ’s body and blood: ‘If you receive them well, you are yourselves what you receive. You see, the apostle says, <em>We, being many, are one loaf, one body</em> (1 Cor. 10:17).’ The comment sounds innocuous enough, but it contains two fascinating elements. First…Augustine says…: <em>You</em> become the body of Christ; <em>you</em> become what you eat…<br><br>

…What [else] did Augustine mean when he said, ‘You are what you have received’? …In the second part of his statement, the Bishop of Hippo quotes the apostle Paul: ‘The bread is one; we, though many, are one body.’ This is a quotation from 1 Corinthians 10:17. The NIV translation renders verses 16b and 17 as follows: ‘And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.’ The word ‘body’ occurs twice in this passage. The first time, it refers to the eucharistic body. (‘Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?’) The second time, it refers to the ecclesial body. (‘Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body.’) Of the three bodies frequently referred to in the Great Tradition (the historical, the eucharistic, and the ecclesial), Paul takes the last two and places them right beside each other. Actually, he does more than place them beside each other; he links them together. He maintains that when, by faith, we share in the one eucharistic body, the Spirit makes us one ecclesial body. As Augustine would put it, we become what we have received. Or as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_De_Lubac">de Lubac</a> famously phrases it, the Eucharist makes the church (114).

This is very interesting. I think that were someone to ask me what *makes* the church, what makes the body of Christ, I’d be more inclined to say that it is baptism, because it is in baptism that we are united to Christ and incorporated into the people of God. Then again, I may want to take one step further back and say that *God* makes the church as he gathers his people in through the saving work of Christ.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding Boersma and Augustine (or just Boersma's reading of Augustine), but it seems to me that to only speak of becoming the body of Christ when we partake of the Eucharist is reductionistic. Certainly the Eucharist is key to the life of the church, and is, among other things, an expression of our union with Christ and with one another, but Scripture refers to the church as an objective reality apart from its gathering around the Lord’s Table. Along with the Reformers (for example, as in [Article XIX](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XIX) of the 39 Articles), I would certainly affirm that the Eucharist is an identifying mark of the of the true church, alongside baptism and the preaching of the Word, but I'd be hesitant to say that it actually *makes* the church.

These are just some initial reactions. Thoughts?
