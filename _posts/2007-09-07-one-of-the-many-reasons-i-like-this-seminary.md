From the student handbook:

<blockquote>
Studying and preparing for class is your primary responsibility before God during your seminary days. Preparation for ministry is a consecrated activity. Commit yourself to preparing thoroughly and approaching your study as a devotional service of worship... [Yet] each student must make difficult decisions regarding how much he/she wants to earn a high grade versus healthy relationships with family and friends. Work hard. Study well. But don't drive yourself crazy.
</blockquote>

Recognizing and appreciating the multiple callings in life. Great advice.
