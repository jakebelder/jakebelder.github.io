<p>Most Christians have, at one time or another during their lives, asked the question, 'What is God's will for my life?' This is especially a question that young people deal with as they go through university, determined to come out the other end with a degree in one hand, and a note from God in the other hand detailing exactly what vocation they need to jump into in order to please him and play their part in the unfolding of his plan.</p>

<p>It is not a bad question to ask, of course, but we need to do so with the right motives and from the right perspective. However, the question often masks one of two different things. In the first place, the question is asked with a genuine desire to  receive an answer from God, but the experience of searching out God's  will becomes something mystical and detached from reality. We forget  that God gives us unique gifts and talents and interests so that we can  serve him in ways that best suit our characters and abilities, and  instead look beyond that, hoping for the Spirit to speak audibly in our  ears telling us what we should be doing. And often we expect that whispering voice to reveal to us that we should serve God as a missionary amongst some unreached people group in the HImalayas, because we think that you can't serve God as a journalist or a factory worker.</p>
<p>In the second place, it often acts as a means to disguise the fact that we really just want to do what we want, and cloaks those desires in religious language, baptising them as God's will. We may have genuine faith, but that faith mixed with selfish ambition may lead us to convince ourselves over time that our desires are actually God's will, when really we are more concerned with the reverse.</p>
<p>I have been reading <a href="http://www.rethinkingworldview.com/" target="_blank">J. Mark Bertrand's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1581349343/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1581349343&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>(Re)thinking Worldview: Learning How to Think, Live, and Speak in this World</em></a>, and in a chapter on wisdom, he illustrates this with a 'parable':</p>
<blockquote>
A certain man went to his friend having already decided on a course of action. The friend could see that his mind was already made up, but the man presented his choice along with several other options and then attempted to guide the friend into agreement with the course he preferred. But the friend had a problem: of all the options on the table, the one the man leaned toward was clearly not biblical. When the friend said so, the man didn't miss a beat.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'Maybe we should pray about it together,' the man suggested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'We don't need to pray about it,' his friend said. 'We already know what the Bible says.'
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'Still, maybe God will give us some insight.'
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But the friend knew better. Whenever the man looked to God for insight, God always seemed to conveniently endorse his course of action.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'God already gave us insight,' the friend replied. 'It's the Bible.'
</blockquote>
<p>The friend in this parable is exactly right. He is not saying that the Bible provides an exhaustive set of answers to the question of what God's will is in a given situation, but instead that as we read and study Scripture, we are shaped and transformed more and more by the wisdom of God revealed to us there. Our minds are renewed as God's truth takes root in us. And as we grow in godliness and Christ-likeness, we are increasingly enabled by the Spirit to do God's will. God's desires become our desires as he works the righteousness of Christ in us.</p>

In one sense, the answer to the question, 'What is God's will for my life?' is simply that we grow in godliness. That is not to downplay the reality that sometimes acting in accordance with God's will is a difficult thing to discern, such as when we have two choices before us, both of which provide us with opportunities to praise and glorify God. But in most cases, doing the will of God becomes something we do more naturally as we grow in holiness. The more we conform ourselves to Christ and the more we submit ourselves to the Word of God, the more we will honour and obey his will in every part of our lives.
