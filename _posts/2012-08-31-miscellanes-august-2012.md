<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted the following Monday. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of August together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>August 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://newsong40.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/o-thou-who-changest-not/" target="_blank">O Thou Who Changest Not</a></strong> &ndash; The 2012 Olympics began last week in London with a rather spectacular ceremony. These sorts of events are not without meaning, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MissJenniep" target="_blank">Jennie Pollock</a> wrote some great reflections on what she saw in the opening ceremonies.</li>
<li><a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/new-must-have-gadget-book.html" target="_blank"><strong>New "must have" gadget &ndash; the BOOK</strong></a> &ndash; Humorous post from <a href="https://twitter.com/stevebishopuk" target="_blank">Steve Bishop</a> on the merits and technological features of the book.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/scriptorium/2012/07/loving-god-and-saying-so-in-the-bible/" target="_blank">Loving God, and Saying So in the Bible</a></strong> &ndash; This is a very interesting post. Contemporary evangelicals don't hesitate to tell God that they love him, but apparently this is not an Old Testament thing to do. Much more prominent in the Old Testament are declarations of love for God's Law.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2012/07/can-we-quantify-good-walk/2755/" target="_blank"><strong>Can We Quantify a Good Walk?</strong></a> &ndash; I found this interesting since my main mode of transportation now is walking. I have noticed too that I enjoy walking far more than I ever did, and this article helps explain why. It has to do with visual appeal, landmarks that help you feel you're making progress, and the availability of different amenities within a reasonable distance.</li>
<li><a href="http://99u.com/articles/6947/What-Happened-to-Downtime-The-Extinction-of-Deep-Thinking-Sacred-Space" target="_blank"><strong>What Happened to Downtime? The Extinction of Deep Thinking &amp; Sacred Space</strong></a> &ndash; This post caught my eye because it's something we all need to learn. We need to be able to unplug once in a while, and the benefits of doing so are significant.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64389P8_r78" target="_blank"><strong>The Birth Of A Tool. Chisel Making</strong></a> &ndash; I'm not entirely sure why, but I found this video absolutely captivating. It shows the process of hand-making a chisel. I think it probably has to do with just watching someone highly skilled produce something with their hands.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/the-dehumanising-metrics-of-modernist-ministry-3-the-past/" target="_blank"><strong>The dehumanising metrics of modernist ministry 3: The Past</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> wraps up this series with another great post, this time looking at how to avoid the trap of thinking everything now is better than it was in the past.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/08/afghanistan-july-2012-faces-of-hope/100345/" target="_blank">Afghanistan, July 2012: Faces of Hope</a></strong> &ndash; Here are some absolutely stunning photographs of the people of Afghanistan. All we ever see on the news, of course, is the conflict and brokenness of that society, but this photo essay captures the beauty and hope of the country's people.</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2012/08/malik/" target="_blank"><strong>Charles Malik on evangelicalism's greatest threat</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/tjhoiland" target="_blank">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> quotes <a href="http://www.udhr.org/history/Biographies/biocm.htm" target="_blank">Malik</a>, who says that anti-intellectualism is the greatest threat to evangelicalism. It's an interesting thought, but I'm not sure I'd fully agree.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEdXhH97Z7E" target="_blank">Real Actors Read Yelp Reviews</a></strong> &ndash; I saw this for the first time yesterday, and I couldn't stop laughing. Take a rather inane <a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> review of a diner, have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456023/" target="_blank">Chris Kipiniak</a> put loads of emotion into reading it, and you have brilliance. Watch this!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3394/after-church" target="_blank"><strong>After Church</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.convergencedesignllc.com/David-Greusel.cfm" target="_blank">David Greusel</a> has a very interesting article in <em><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/" target="_blank">Comment</a></em> magazine about the way art has replaced the church's role in defining spirituality in culture. He argues that the church needs to recover this role as 'curator of the transcendent'&nbsp; in our culture, essentially by planting itself in the middle of the arts. It's an interesting idea, and true in certain places, I think. But I'm not sure the problem and/or solution is applicable across all of Western culture. I would have a hard time saying it's true, for instance, in the city I live in.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/olympic-gold-is-proportional-to-gdp.html" target="_blank">Olympic Gold is proportional to GDP</a></strong> &ndash; This was very interesting. <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Cranmer</a> notes how certain countries have no hopes of winning gold in certain sports because of the lack of resources needed. Interesting analysis.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3395/a-perennial-moment-of-opportunity" target="_blank"><strong>A Perennial Moment of Opportunity</strong></a> &ndash; Again in <em><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/" target="_blank">Comment</a></em> magazine, <a href="http://www.vincentbacote.com/" target="_blank">Vincent Bacote</a>, in this excellent post, notes the welcome trend amongst younger evangelicals to want a holistic worldview, yet notes a deficiency in their knowledge of Scripture. He asks, "Where will we turn to guide us to a faith that is truly for all of life?" We need God's Word to saturate our lives.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/08/13/120813crat_atlarge_gopnik?currentPage=all" target="_blank"><strong>I, Nephi: Mormonism and its meanings</strong></a> &ndash; A very interesting article about Mormonism in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank"><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, well worth reading. Adam Gopnik looks at Mormonism's past and some of its beliefs, and notes that what was once perceived as a strange and dangerous cult to most Americans has now morphed into a Gospel of Wealth that is much less distinctive from the rest of American culture.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/08/157754542/the-most-influential-evangelist-youve-never-heard-of" target="_blank"><strong>The Most Influential Evangelist You've Never Heard Of</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.npr.org" target="_blank">NPR</a> has a piece on a Texan pastor named David Barton who claims to be a historian, but has no training as such and peddles a distorted and rose-coloured history of America that many evangelicals are happy to eat up. This is golden age historiography <em>par excellence</em>, and it is unreal how many people buy into it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/the-future-of-evangelicals-in-europe/" target="_blank"><strong>The future of Evangelicals in Europe</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor" target="_blank">Phil Whittall</a> cites <a href="http://www.thefutureoftheglobalchurch.org/about/author/" target="_blank">Patrick Johnstone</a> on five challenges to evangelical ministry in Europe. It's a very interesting list, and he's asking for your thoughts on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html" target="_blank"><strong>One Race, Every Medalist Ever - Interactive Graphic</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has put together this really interesting video comparing Usain Bolt to the Olympic sprinters over the last 116 years.</li>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/46599918" target="_blank"><strong>Skylights &ndash; Timelapse Film</strong></a> &ndash; Here is an absolutely stunning timelapse film of the sky over New Mexico, filmed in areas where there is no light pollution. The wonders of creation caught on camera here will take your breath away.</li>
<li><a href="http://richardlittledale.me.uk/2012/08/17/every-picture-tells/" target="_blank"><strong>Every picture tells a story</strong></a> &ndash; A good post here from <a href="http://twitter.com/richardlittleda" target="_blank">Richard Littledale</a> on how we need to open our eyes and see all the stories being told in the world around us. Every person we see on a street corner has a story, and we should be aware of that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19310319" target="_blank"><strong>Mobile phone throwing in Finland</strong></a> &ndash; It's stuff like this that makes Finland awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/final-judgment/08/" target="_blank"><strong>Final Judgment, Part One</strong></a> &ndash; Countering the popular notion that Christians will be spared from any future judgement, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood</a> looks at what we neglect or deny when we hold to this idea.</li>
<li><a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/2012/8/20/christianity-as-a-foreign-tongue" target="_blank"><strong>Christianity as a Foreign Tongue</strong></a> &ndash; A good post on why forgiveness is unique to Christianity, and how noticeable its absence is from modern culture.</li>
<li><a href="http://gardensdontlaunch.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/plant-repentance/" target="_blank"><strong>Plant Repentance</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager" target="_blank">Andy Stager</a>, currently <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hillcitysc" target="_blank">planting a church</a> in Rock Hill, South Carolina, has an excellent post on his blog about the need for pastors to model repentance.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/tracing-borders-of-earthly-city.html?paging=off&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;buffer_share=27590" target="_blank"><strong>How (Not) to Be Worldly: Tracing the Borders of the 'Earthly City'</strong></a> &ndash; An excellent article by <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith" target="_blank">James K.A. Smith</a> on a proper understanding of 'worldliness' and the 'earthly city'. He  writes, "The term 'earthly city' [shouldn't be used] to carve up reality  into a 'heavenly' second  story and an 'earthly' first floor. No, both  the earthly city and the  City of God are rival visions of heaven <em>and</em> earth." And our duty is to work to reorder the earthly city, bringing shalom as it is brought back under the rule of God.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2012/08/a-man-of-god" target="_blank">A Man of God</a></strong> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart" target="_blank">Peter Leithart</a> has a great post here on what should characterize a preacher. If you're  a pastor, read this. It is very convicting. He concludes, "What a  congregation finally needs is assurance that the man who speaks  to them  from the pulpit every week is capable of bringing God&rsquo;s word  because  he is acquainted with the Father of Jesus Christ through the  filling of  their Spirit."</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/thabitianyabwile/2012/08/24/im-tired-of-hearing-the-gospel-warning-mild-rant/" target="_blank"><strong>I&rsquo;m Tired of Hearing &ldquo;The Gospel&rdquo; (Warning: Mild Rant)</strong></a> - Over on The Gospel Coalition blog, <a href="http://www.fbc.org.ky/our_people/our-people/" target="_blank">Thabiti Anyabwile</a> writes, "As blasphemous as it sounds, 'the gospel' is not the answer to every question." He makes a great point, urging us to stop giving pat answers and to do the hard work of thinking through the implications of the gospel for our lives.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/08/confused-by-complementarianism.php" target="_blank"><strong>Confused by Complementarianism?  You probably should be.</strong></a> - <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html" target="_blank">Carl Trueman</a> makes the case that complementarianism is not a gospel issue. Why, he asks, do groups like TGC make the issue a matter of whether or not they can work together while ignoring much bigger theological issues such as baptism? I've often wondered the same.</li>
<li><a href="http://shoredfragments.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/why-complementarianism-matters-reflections-occasioned-by-carl-trueman/" target="_blank"><strong>Why &lsquo;complementarianism&rsquo; matters: reflections occasioned by Carl Trueman</strong></a> - However, <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveRHolmes" target="_blank">Steve Holmes</a>, despite opposing the principle that women shouldn't lead in the church, goes on in response to make a case for complementarianism being an important defining mark of TGC because of the importance of praxis defining unity in parachurch organisations. Quite an interesting read.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/an-important-tool-for-learning-the-bible/08/" target="_blank">Learning to Read the Bible</a></strong> - A really interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood</a> on how many evangelicals simply do not know how to read and understand a text.</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2012/08/newbigin-history/" target="_blank"><strong>Lesslie Newbigin on the Bible's unique interpretation of history</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland" target="_blank">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> has been reading some great stuff from Lesslie Newbigin on why the Bible is key to making sense of all of reality.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.frame-poythress.org/digital-ethics-and-file-formats/" target="_blank"><strong>Digital Ethics and File Formats</strong></a> - I ditched Windows last week in favour of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> (which has restored my faith in the possibilities of PCs), after which I was pointed to this very interesting article by <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/vpoythress.html" target="_blank">Vern Poythress</a> on the ethics of open source software, and why we might all consider using it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apolojet.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/is-christianity-political/" target="_blank">Is Christianity Political?</a></strong> - <a href="http://twitter.com/JosephETorres" target="_blank">Joseph Torres</a> posted an interesting video conversation between Mark Dever, Voddie Baucham and Bill Kynes and has a few interesting thoughts about it on his blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/08/after-the-sermon/" target="_blank"><strong>After the Sermon&hellip;</strong></a> - What part of worship follows the sermon at your church? <a href="http://twitter.com/mbird12" target="_blank">Michael Bird</a> makes an interesting case for a creed or confession of faith to follow the sermon.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/08/31/study-most-churchgoers-never-share-the-gospel/" target="_blank"><strong>Study: Most Churchgoers Never Share the Gospel</strong></a> - Again at the TGC blog, a recent study by <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Article/research-survey-sharing-christ-2012" target="_blank">LifeWay</a> demonstrates a real reticence among Christians to share the gospel. The results are quite interesting, although I can't say I am really surprised.</li>
