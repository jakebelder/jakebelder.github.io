<p>One blog I follow with interest is <a href="http://www.thinkchristian.net">ThinkChristian.net</a>. There are a number of contributors to the site, and they often provide thoughtful and stimulating content. <a href="http://www.thinkchristian.net/index.php/2010/01/11/the-messiness-of-church-history-thoughts-for-a-new-year/">Nathan Bierma's latest post</a> is no exception, as he wrestles with the messiness of Church history. It can get ugly when you are honest about the history of the Church, but I think his point is neatly summed up when he writes, "The messiness of church history testifies to our utter reliance on Christ as the foundation of the church."</p>
<p>This was of particular interest to me because of my passion for studying the history of the Church. When you do a survey of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_history">that history </a>you necessarily end up spending a lot of time looking at things that went terribly wrong. And you don't need to know a lot of the Church's history to know that there are some pretty ugly stains there. It can be discouraging and difficult to swallow. But at the same time, there is always cause for rejoicing because despite it all, the promise of Jesus Christ has proven true: "I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:18;&amp;version=47;">Matt. 16:18</a>).</p>
<p>The story of redemption and the story of history always has in view the work of God in preserving a remnant of His people, and this is no different with the Church. The last 2000 years of history serve as nothing more than a testament to God's sovereign work of providence, and without that understanding you are left to wonder how the Church ever survived&mdash;how she endured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_early_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire">persecution at the hands of the Romans</a>, how she sifted through the proliferation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_church#Orthodoxy_and_heterodoxy">theological error and heresy in the early Church</a>, how she was preserved despite the decline of culture in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ages">Dark Ages</a>, how she recovered from the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Papacy#Medieval_Church"> incredible degree of corruption in the leadership</a> of the medieval Church, how she dealt with the splitting and dividing of the Church after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation">Reformation</a>, and later worked to weed out the infiltration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">Enlightenment thought and liberalism</a>, among other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How? It is really quite simple: "I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p>
<p>When we look at the Church and only see the failings of man, we have missed the point. The Church is not about what man has done, but about what God has done and is doing. She is his bride whom He loves, protects, and cherishes. Nothing in this world, not even the gates of hell, shall prevail against it. The well-known hymn, "<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/c/h/chofound.htm">The Church's One Foundation</a>," has this glorious verse which, although sung more infrequently than some of the other verses, sums up this point:</p>
<blockquote>
The Church shall never perish!<br />Her dear Lord to defend,<br />To guide, sustain, and cherish,<br />Is with her to the end:<br />Though there be those who hate her,<br />And false sons in her pale,<br />Against both foe or traitor<br />She ever shall prevail.</blockquote>

We as God's people, the Church, are built up on Jesus, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:19-21;&amp;version=47;">the chief cornerstone</a>, and no one can lay <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%203:11;&amp;version=47;">any other foundation</a>.  With this assurance we can boldly proclaim, "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it!"
