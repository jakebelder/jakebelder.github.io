Though I don't remember where I heard it, I recall being told once that [Mark Driscoll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Driscoll_(pastor)) insisted on sermons being at least an hour long if they were going to be worthwhile. I'm not sure he actually said that, but he is well known for regularly preaching for at least sixty minutes. There are many people, like Driscoll, who lament the decline in length of sermons as a capitulation to the soundbyte generation we live in, and I must admit I've sometimes thought the same, wondering how anyone could do justice to a text in seven minutes.

The whole question of how long a sermon should be is an interesting one, and it seems that opinions on the matter often have to do with personal preference. So what kind of things need to be taken into consideration on the question? [Gilbert Burnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Burnet), the 17th-century Bishop of Salisbury, offers these thoughts:

<blockquote>
The shorter sermons are, they are generally both better heard, and better remembered. The custom of an hour's length forces many preachers to trifle away much of the time, and to spin out their matter, so as to hold out. So great a length also does flat the hearers, and tempt them to sleep; especially when, as is usual, the first part of the sermon is languid and heavy. In half an hour, a man may lay open his matter in its full extent, and cut off those superfluities which come in only to lengthen the discourse. And he may hope to keep up the attention of his people all the while (from <em>A Discourse of the Pastoral Care</em>, 1692).
</blockquote>

As my sermons seem to fall in a remarkably consistent 28-31 minute range, I'm glad to know this would meet with Burnet's approval. But in all seriousness, the question seems to be, in the end, less about the length of the sermon as it is the quality and efficiency of exposition and engagement (or application). And although I'm sympathetic to the refusal to bow to the soundbyte generation, I am also aware that brevity has its merits, especially if we want people to remember and understand.
