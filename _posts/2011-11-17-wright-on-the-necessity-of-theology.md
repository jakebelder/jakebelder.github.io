<p>A recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0281062137/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0281062137"><em>Jesus, Paul, and the People of God: A Theological Dialogue with N.T. Wright</em></a>, is a collection of essays from a range of different scholars, interacting with Wright's thought on a number of different issues. Among the essays is one by Wright himself on Pauline studies and the life of the church. In that essay, just before the conclusion, Wright makes an important remark about the necessity of theology for the church. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
We need theology... We need it, not because it's a nice thing to get our ideas sorted out and our heads organised so that we can do the jigsaw of all these wonderful ideas. We need it because without prayerful reflective investigation of who God is, who the people of God are and what is the hope that belongs to our calling, without that prayerful, wise investigation the worldview whose central symbol is the one church of Jesus Christ will not be sustainable. Think of the churches that have given up theology, and you'll see what I mean.
</blockquote>
<p>To that, I have nothing to add.</p>
