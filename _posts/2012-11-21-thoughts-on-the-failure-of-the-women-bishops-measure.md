<p>Late last week, as the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org" target="_blank">Church of England's</a> General Synod was preparing to vote on a measure to permit the ordination of women to the episcopate, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/some-scattered-thoughts-about-conservative-ev" target="_blank">I posted at length about the position of conservative evangelicals in the Church of England</a>. Many conservatives were deeply concerned about the lack of provision for their traditional understanding of ecclesiastical office and ordination, and hoped that Synod would not vote in favour of the measure. Their fears were temporarily allayed last night as the measure was defeated in the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/general-synod/about-general-synod/house-of-laity.aspx" target="_blank">House of Laity</a>.</p>
<p>I admit surprise at the outcome, as I was quite certain the measure would pass. Indeed, the outcome demonstrated a significant majority favoured the measure, but to pass it required a two-thirds majority, and that consensus was not reached. Since I wrote about the matter last week, I thought I would offer a few additional thoughts in response to what transpired last night.</p>
<p>Shortly before the vote was scheduled to take place, I signed on to Twitter to follow the proceedings. However, as soon as the count was in, I was deeply saddened to see the reaction of some of those in favour of the measure. The amount of tweets containing vicious and vitriolic responses to those who voted against the measure was rather shocking. I am thankful for those who both opposed and supported the measure who responded in a godly manner, with love and charity. This has been a deeply divisive issue, and as we deal with these sorts of issues, we need to do all we can to avoid descending into bitter tribalism. May those who responded well serve as models for how we continue to move forward in this conversation.</p>

<p>One of the concerns that repeatedly surfaced from amongst those in favour of the measure was that, should the measure not pass, the church would be viewed by the world as backwards and irrelevant. To be sure, this might very well be the case. However, as I said in my previous post, this cannot in any way serve as justification for the measure, let alone any ecclesial practice. The ideologies of our culture do not shape the life of the church. Only Scripture does. If we want to argue for or against the ordination of women, that argument must be based solely on biblical and theological grounds. There have been people on both sides of the debate who have rightly grounded their perspective in Scripture. But when the issue is argued for on the basis of aligning the church with the views of culture, those arguments must carry no weight.</p>
<p>Primary among the concerns of the Church of England must be shaping and moulding our beliefs and practices in accordance with Scripture. Sometimes that will result in disagreement, as we have seen in this situation, and then we will need to do the work of figuring out how we work together with our differing convictions. But when cultural beliefs and practices usurp the primacy and authority of Scripture, then we have a serious problem. I hope that many more people will commit themselves to understanding the issue of the ordination of women from a biblical perspective, and that when the matter comes to Synod again, the debate will focus exclusively on the Bible's teaching on the role of men and women in the church.</p>
<p>When we commit ourselves to shaping our ecclesial life around Scripture, we should expect that we will look different to the world around us. The church, after all, is a people who are set apart and who find their identity in the risen and ascended Lord Jesus Christ. Our life is to be shaped by his rule alone, and our ultimate concern must be that we are conformed to his will. In many cases, this will make us look radically different from the world around us. In other cases it will affirm some of the good things in our culture. It was supposed to be the radical 'otherness' of Israel that would draw the nations to them to hear of the great God of heaven and earth. Likewise in the church we must make known in word and deed that we belong to another Kingdom, in order that those around us will be drawn in to discover the fullness of life that is found in living faithfully before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>If we are concerned about how the church looks in the eyes of the world, then we should be concerned to stand apart and not to conform ourselves to the ideals of our culture and society. The church is never called to blend in or subject herself to external standards. And we should especially demonstrate that in how we react to those within the church who we disagree with, working to show the world our unity in Christ and our love for one another. The church is often called out on its hypocrisy, and last night there was good reason for that accusation. That sends a message to our culture that is far more troubling than not submitting to its perspectives on gender.</p>
<p>All that being said, the vote last night was ultimately <em>not</em> about the ordination of women. Conservatives know that women will be ordained as bishops eventually; that is inevitable given the position the Church of England right now. The issue last night was about the provision made for those of traditional understandings. Had more robust provision been made, then the measure would have easily passed. It is wholly unfair that conservatives are accosted with accusations of hating women, or the like. That represents a fundamental misunderstanding of their position, particularly the view of conservative evangelicals. The Church of England claims to be an inclusive church, and the failure of the measure demonstrated that Synod did not feel it would promote that inclusiveness.</p>
<p>So where do we go from here? For one, we cannot escape the fact that the place of women in the church, particularly with regards to leadership, is a necessary part of this discussion. As someone who finds himself in conservative evangelical circles, I think conservatives need to do a better of job of answering the question of the place of women in the life of the church. This is a key time to take the opportunity to deal with that question and move the discussion forward. Much time has been spent debating and discussing what women <em>cannot</em> do, and I have seen people do thorough biblical and theological work as they have sought to understand the teaching of Scripture on that matter. Now they need to approach the question of what women <em>can</em> do with the same diligence. It is all very good for conservative evangelicals to uphold the understanding that men and women, while equal, have different roles. The role of men in the life of the church is made very clear, but what of the role of women? Because this is one of the main points of contention in the discussion with those who favour the ordination of women, I hope conservative evangelicals will put great effort into defining the roles of both sexes, and demonstrating what their complementarian understanding looks like in practice.</p>
<p>In general, though, we need to re-learn how to have these conversations. Many on either side of the issue have lost the ability to dialogue with love and charity. These issues get talked about within our own camps, and all we seem to do is lob some general arguments and perspectives between our respective camps, safely keeping our distance. But what about actually sitting down together with Scripture, and talking and exegeting the relevant texts together? To be sure, we will not all agree on each other's interpretation, but a process like this would be helpful in fully understanding where the other is coming from, and moving us closer to accepting the validity of each other's perspectives.</p>
<p>As I write that, however, I recognise that although the Church of England desires to be a home to varying interpretations of different issues, this sort of unity is always going to be fraught with tension. Clashes like we saw at Synod yesterday and in the debates leading up to it are inevitable as long as we continue to try to hold together an institution that is made up of churches and people who begin with very different presuppositions. And so, as I said in my last post, I remain sceptical about the future of the Church of England. I do not think we can resolve our differences in a way that makes everyone happy. For conservative evangelicals, again, I think it is time to sit down and have some serious conversations about the future.</p>

However, at the end of the day, let us recognise that God is still sovereign over all, and that our fundamental calling is to bear witness to the risen and ascended Lord Jesus Christ. The issues we discuss and debate cannot overshadow our calling to proclaim the good news of the gospel and to encourage, equip, and build up the members of our congregations in faith and love for Christ. Let us recommit ourselves to that mission, and move forward knowing that when we are faithful to the calling the Lord has given us, he will bless us and use us to be a blessing to the world around us.
