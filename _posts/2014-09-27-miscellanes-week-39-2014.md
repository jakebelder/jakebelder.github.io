Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>21-27 September 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1uiyMlA">How to Survive the Secular Apocalypse</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/knflatt">Kevin Flatt</a> suggests that secularism is crumbling around us, and makes some helpful suggestions as to how Christians can respond to that.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ufMuJq">On not being converted</a></strong> – Reflecting on Jesus' calling of Matthew to be his disciple, <a href="http://twitter.com/RevJFletcher">Jeremy Fletcher</a> has some good thoughts on how for so many of us, conversion is an ongoing process.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mGt4v2">Where to go to Church</a></strong> – Here is a rather interesting piece on what kinds of things you should consider when choosing a church. The author ends up suggesting that a church should be chosen 'first and foremost, for its theological positions and, secondarily, for all of the other great benefits that it could offer'. There is an interesting conversation to be had here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1soNKKu">Do Christian Schools Produce Good Citizens? The Evidence Says Yes.</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/cardusca">Cardus</a>, a Canadian think tank, has done some very interesting research on how different types of schools prepare children for life in wider society. You can read some of the results here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1um3s93">Recreated in Four Dimensions</a></strong> – Here is a deeply encouraging piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> on what our baptism actually does to us. If you've never really taken the time to stop and think about what your baptism means, do it now.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1rcrbHw">Children Who Never Play</a></strong> – This is a really interesting piece on the benefits of letting children play, particularly in unsupervised environments, and how it forms them as people and as members of society.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1rcWu51">Busy is Blasphemy</a></strong> – We all say we're busy from time to time, but perhaps we ought not to. Here is a great post that suggests saying you're busy is a weapon of pride and self-interest, and you just need to stop it.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1vn6aJy">The importance of testimony</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> has an interesting post on the role of testimony in sharing the faith. I was interested to read this, as I've reflected on it before too, both on <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/on-the-effectiveness-of-sharing-personal-testimonies">the effectiveness</a> and <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/does-your-testimony-point-to-jesus-or-to-yourself">the necessary content</a> of testimonies.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1BgcVO5">What do we do when the Bible is ‘wrong’?</a></strong> – Another helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> this week, this time on how we deal with parts of the Bible that seem to be wrong based on what we know from other sources, and especially when we want to uphold the authority of Scripture.</li>
