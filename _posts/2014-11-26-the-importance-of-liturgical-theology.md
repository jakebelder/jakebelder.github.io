Theologians often argue about which area of theology is most important, the debate being particularly pronounced between biblical theologians and systematic theologians. Last week, [Derek Rishmawy](http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy) offered his own take on the issue:

<a href="https://twitter.com/DZRishmawy/status/536263321091969025"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Screen%20Shot%202014-11-26%20at%2009.49.32.png"></a>

In response, [Alastair Roberts](http://twitter.com/zugzwanged) posted about [twelve tweets](https://twitter.com/zugzwanged/status/536284144612167680) (yes, as prolific a tweeter as he is a [blogger](http://t.co/5NekZ5KmR3)), stringing together a number of thoughts on why he thinks liturgical theology might actually be the most important area of theology. For the sake of ease of reading, I have slightly edited his tweets and put them together into paragraph format:

<blockquote>
I am not sure I agree with Derek. Liturgical theology (perhaps also ethics) has always been my favourite area of theology. I've always had wide theological and academic interests, but liturgical theology has long been my integrating focus.<br><br>

Liturgy forces you to bring together both systematic and biblical theology, not as abstract fields of knowledge, but embedded in rich and variegated traditions of practice, and relate them to the prevailing conditions of belief, identity, and community, discerning the ways in which texts and practices form us, instructing and guiding persons in their effective use, crafting new practices of our own, relating to truth of God to the life of the body, and constantly attending to the ways our theology is or isn't validated in the lives and practice of the Church and its members. All the streams of theology converge at and flow from the font. <br><br>

The loss resulting from neglect of liturgical theology is immense, leaving us only the penultimacy of both biblical and systematic theology. Unlike most biblical theology, liturgical theology places the Scriptures in the context of the reading/formation of the community of the heirs and executors of the biblical testaments. Unlike most systematic theology, liturgical theology approaches Christian doctrine, not as second order reflection, but as preached summons and living confession. For me, liturgical theology has always been the discipline most constitutionally committed to the non-abstractness of Christian theology.
</blockquote>

Some fascinating insights here, and as an Anglican, I find myself resonating deeply with his comments. Someone asked Alastair where they could begin reading on the sort of thing he is suggesting here, and in response he points them to [Alexander Schmemann’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Schmemann) book, *[For the Life of the World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0913836087/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0913836087&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, as 'a book that captures the spirit of the sort of thing that I am arguing for’, a recommendation I would heartily echo.

On the whole, though, Alastair observes that there is still much work to be done here (he briefly notes that he wants to write a book on the subject, and I certainly hope he does). But if liturgical theology is as important as he suggests it is, then hopefully we will see scholars increasingly devoting themselves to this area of theology.
