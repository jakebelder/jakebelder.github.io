<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                       share a variety of articles and posts and other             interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the   web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are    interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are     collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<li><a href="http://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/no_april_fool" target="_blank"><strong>No April Fool</strong></a> - For April Fools' Day (which fell on Easter Monday this year), <a href="http://twitter.com/MissJennieP" target="_blank">Jennie Pollock</a> has some good thoughts on how the resurrection of Jesus was no joke. It is the greatest triumph ever.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.faithandwork.org/resources/author/Katherine-Alsdorf-63/Work-What-is-it-Good-For-r236" target="_blank"><strong>Work: What is it Good For?</strong></a> - Here is a video of a conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/timkellernyc" target="_blank">Tim Keller</a> and Katherine Alsdorf on work. I haven't had the chance to watch it yet, but these two are some of the most helpful thinkers on a Christian perspectives of work.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qideas.org/video/kuyper-revisted.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Christians in a Postmodern Culture</strong></a> - I ran across another great video, this time with <a href="http://twitter.com/drantbradley" target="_blank">Anthony Bradley</a> talking about how Abraham Kuyper can inform our cultural engagement today. This is eight minutes well worth watching.</li>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/61487989" target="_blank"><strong>Time-Lapse | Earth</strong></a> - Here is a time-lapse video of earth as seen from the International Space Station. This is absolutely incredible, and will take your breath away. The heavens certainly do declare the glory of God!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2013/04/pastors-and-criticism.php" target="_blank"><strong>Pastors and Their Critics: Pastors</strong></a> - A good post here on how to handle criticism as a pastor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2013/04/pastors-and-their-critics-crit.php" target="_blank"><strong>Pastors and Their Critics: Critics</strong></a> - And here is a follow-up on how those who bring criticism to their pastor should do it.</li>
