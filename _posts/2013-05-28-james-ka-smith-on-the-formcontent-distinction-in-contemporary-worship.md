One of the main points [James K.A. Smith](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) makes in the two published volumes of his '[Cultural Liturgies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVs0kW7QWU)' project, *[Desiring the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035775/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035775&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, and *[Imagining the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035783&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, is that we are shaped less by what we think and believe than by what we love and desire. He uses the term 'liturgical animals' of human beings to describe the reality that we are formed by liturgies, Christian and otherwise, that seek to inculcate in us, by way of a set of practices and habits, a particular vision of 'the good life'. These practices train us to respond instinctively to that vision so that we begin to live in service and pursuit of this good life. Because of this, Smith argues that Christian worship is fundamental to shaping our hearts to pursue the right vision of the good life, formed by the gospel.

However, because of our constitution as 'liturgical animals', Christian worship must be concerned about more than just the message. We need to be intentional, Smith argues, about the *forms* of worship as well because of their formative power. In *[Imagining the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035783&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, he goes on to level the following critique at much of contemporary worship, which largely misses this point:

<blockquote>
Wide swaths of contemporary Christianity have bought into a specious form/content distinction: we have assumed that Christianity is primarily a ‘message’ and is thus defined by a ‘content’ that is distillable from historical forms. Along with this distinction comes the assumption that forms are basically just neutral containers for the message, selected on the basis of taste, preference, or cultural relevance. With that distinction in place (perhaps unwittingly), we then treat the historical, received forms of Christian worship as a kind of disposable husk that can be shucked (and chucked!) as long as we keep the kernel of the gospel ‘message’. When this distinction and attitude are wedded to our late modern penchant for novelty, we begin to approach Christian worship as an event for disseminating the message and thus look for forms that will be fresh, attractive, relevant, accessible, and so on. In fact, since on this account it is the content/’message’ that matters, and since forms are neutral ‘containers’ for the message, we might actually adopt forms that are more familiar and less strange for contemporary ‘audiences’. For example, we might distill the ‘message’ of the gospel and then place it in a ‘mall’ container, or a ‘coffee shop’ container, or a ‘rock concert’ container, or a ‘rave’ container, or what have you. In doing so, we believe that we have in a sense sanctified these forms – taken them up in service to the gospel, all with a ‘missional’ intent (168).
</blockquote>

The forms of worship embody the message, and in turn enable us to embody that message in our own lives. When we fail to understand this and disregard the forms of worship, we open ourselves up to being shaped by competing narratives that are distilled through the world's carefully thought-out forms and liturgies. If you doubt this, just read Smith's illustration of the mall-as-temple [in the opening pages of *Desiring the Kingdom*](http://www.thedivineconspiracy.org/Z5239S.pdf) (the illustration begins on page 19). Form matters immensely.
