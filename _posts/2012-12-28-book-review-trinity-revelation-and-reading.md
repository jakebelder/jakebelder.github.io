<p><a href="https://www.rts.edu/Seminary/faculty/bio.aspx?id=403" target="_blank">Scott Swain</a>, professor of systematic theology at Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida, has recently published a book on the doctrine of Scripture, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0567265404/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0567265404" target="_blank"><em>Trinity, Revelation, and Reading: A Theological Introduction to the Bible and its Interpretation</em></a> (London: T&T Clark International, 2011).</p>

<p>While there are no shortage of books on the doctrine of Scripture, there is something fresh about Swain's approach, which makes it stand out amongst the others. Instead of systematically working through the usual questions covered in a book on Scripture, the key question this book seeks to answer is, 'What roles do Holy Scripture and the reading of Holy Scripture play within the unfolding drama of the commerce and communion between God and humanity?'</p>
<p>Swain begins with a treatment of the doctrine of Scripture that will not be unfamiliar to readers from the Reformed tradition, addressing such topics as the sufficiency, clarity, and authority of Scripture. But these discussions are set within a larger discussion of how the Triune God relates to his creation as King and exercises his rule by means of his covenantal Word, and traces the unfolding of that revelation in the story of redemption.</p>
<p>Particular attention is given to the role Scripture plays in the covenantal relationship between God and humanity, and the way God has faithfully communicated that Word by means of his spokespersons down through the centuries. Swain clearly demonstrates the inspiration and authority of Scripture, and makes plain that the Bible is absolutely indispensable to those who wish to be in fellowship with God. It is both the means by which God rules over his covenantal people as King, and by which he reveals to them who he is, who they are, and how they are to live before him. Without Scripture, we cannot be incorporated into the covenant, because God administers his covenant through his Word.</p>
<p>As members of this covenant, then, we are responsible to actively engage in the reading of Scripture, and this is what Swain addresses in the final two chapters of his book. We are enjoined to understand our part as covenant people in reading Scripture, both corporately as the church, and individually. Swain looks closely at the role of the church in facilitating this act of reading, as well as the rule of faith, which gives readers a set of lenses to use when approaching and interpreting Scripture. Finally, he urges us to read Scripture prayerfully, to attend to its explication, to meditate on it, and to work hard to determine its application to our lives. He concludes that the ultimate end of application is adoration, that we are brought into deeper fellowship with and love for God.</p>
<p>One thing that sets this book apart from other treatments of the doctrine of Scripture is that, where many are reasoned, rational, and systematic, Swain's has something dynamic about it, owing to its focus on a God who desires to bring his people into a living and active covenant relationship with himself through his living and active Word. Even though some may find the book to be more academic and challenging, readers are drawn into the wonder of this covenant relationship and God's manifest love and graciousness in revealing himself to us and calling us his friends through the work of Christ. Swain encourages us to see the blessings of being transformed by the Word of God, and readers will be left with a desire to be brought into deeper fellowship with God by immersing themselves further in Scripture.</p>
