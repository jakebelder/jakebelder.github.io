There are very few things that I am jealous of, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rowe">Mike Rowe's</a> voice is one of them.  However, that's besides the point.

This talk he gave at the 2008 <a href="http://www.the-eg.com/">Entertainment Gathering</a> addresses something that has largely been lost in our culture&mdash;the intrinsic value of work.  He uses some very vivid imagery (you've been warned!) and colorful stories to make his point.  Unfortunately, he misses a couple of key things, such as the fact that work has intrinsic value because it is both a creational norm (and part of the cultural mandate) and an act of worship.  Also, our work is good and finds value insofar as it brings glory to God, and only secondarily from what it contributes to society or culture.   Nonetheless, there's some food for thought here.<br /><br />
