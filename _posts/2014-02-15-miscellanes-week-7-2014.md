Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>09-15 February 2014</strong>.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/NxxxA2">Evangelicals shouldn't be anti-intellectual</a></strong> – An article appeared in a major UK newspaper recently from an anonymous professor who essentially claimed that evangelical students were trying to run his religion course because they wouldn't engage with beliefs other than their own. <a href="http://twitter.com/davebish">Dave Bish</a> offers a helpful response here with some thoughts on how Christians should engage in university settings.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://nyti.ms/NxxG6o">Is Atheism Irrational?</a></strong> – An interview appeared in the New York Times this week with Christian philosopher, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a>, on why atheism cannot not make sense. The interview is very interesting and it's worth your time to work through it.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eWsxyq">The New Centre of British Evangelicalism</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a> had a very interesting and perceptive analysis this week on why <a href="http://htb.org.uk">Holy Trinity Brompton</a> could be considered the centre of British Evangelicalism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eWsCSR">Holy Trinity Brompton and the New Form of British Evangelicalism</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> then followed that up with some thoughts on why this has happened and some of the problems posed by this kind of Evangelicalism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eWsTVX">What Next for Justin?</a></strong> – The Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://twitter.com/JustinWelby">Justin Welby</a>, currently finds himself in a difficult place, as <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould</a> observes in this helpful post. His next steps are incredibly important if the Church of England is going to have any hope of staying together.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gu7AuD">Atheism is hard…but so is belief</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/TheosElizabeth">Elizabeth Oldfield</a> has some good thoughts here on why it's important for Christians to acknowledge that sometimes believing can be hard.</li>
