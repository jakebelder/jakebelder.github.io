<p>Somewhat to even my surprise, I have taken quite a bit of interest in the General Synod of the <a href="http://cofe.anglican.org">Church of England</a> this year. In the last few weeks I heard that there is to be a discussion surrounding the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net">Anglican Church in North America (ACNA)</a> and whether or not the Church of England should enter into communion with that body. A number of students and staff here at RTS attend or are on staff with churches joined with the ACNA, and so I have had the opportunity to become more familiar with it over the past few years. I have been reading different things around the internet to try and get some perspective on the issue, but there is a lot of material to work through.</p>
<p>The woman who initially raised what is called a "private member's motion," Lorna Ashworth, <a href="http://thinkinganglicans.org.uk/uploads/gs1764a.html">published a document</a> highlighting a number of what she calls injustices done by the Episcopal Church in the US against various bishops and clergy, including the deposition of men like J.I. Packer. She writes, "It is my desire to   give Synod an opportunity to hear about the unfair treatment of people who have continued to   maintain the Anglican faith in doctrine,  practice and worship,  and to express their   continuing fellowship with them as loyal Anglicans." Expressed at the beginning of the motion is her desire to see the Church of England to enter into communion with the ACNA, the proposal of which will be discussed by the Synod on this coming Wednesday.</p>
<p>What makes this interesting is that, technically speaking, the ACNA is a schismatic body. Ashworth states that a number of bishops and clergy had been deposed from the Anglican Communion, but many others have voluntarily withdrawn and together formed the new organization. What would be the implications of the Church of England were to enter into communion with the ACNA? What does such a move convey?</p>
<p>It is no secret that the Anglican Communion worldwide is in trouble; it has been in such a state for quite some time now, as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFCON">GAFCON</a> conference in 2008 brought to the forefront in a very visible way. Many conservative bodies around the world (such as the ACNA) demonstrated their difficulties with the pervasive liberalism in the Anglican Communion and its departure from general biblical teaching. So if the Church of England were to enter into communion with one of these conservative bodies, is that an indication of perhaps a new direction in the Anglican Communion? I know it is very premature to be talking about something like that, but it must be on a few people's minds, right? Then again, I may be totally off the mark.</p>
