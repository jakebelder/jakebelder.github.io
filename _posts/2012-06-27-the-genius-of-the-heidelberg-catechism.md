<p>Whenever I get to the opportunity to talk about the <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_main.cfm" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a>, I do. As I have said before, I was raised on the Catechism, and although the task of memorising large portions of it as a child was something of a chore, I am now grateful that I was made to do so. As I grew up, I recognised the value of the theological grounding it gave me, and it is enjoyable to still be able to recall phrases from it. The first question and answer of the Catechism is a particular favourite of many Christians, and for good reason. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Q. What is your only comfort in life and in death?</strong><br>
<br>
A. That I am not my own,<br>
but belong—<br>
body and soul,<br>
in life and in death—<br>
to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood,<br>
and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.<br>
He also watches over me in such a way<br>
that not a hair can fall from my head<br>
without the will of my Father in heaven:<br>
in fact, all things must work together for my salvation.<br>
<br>
Because I belong to him,<br>
Christ, by his Holy Spirit,<br>
assures me of eternal life<br>
and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready<br>
from now on to live for him.
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much packed into that beautiful statement of faith, and this is representative of the character of the Catechism as a whole. The church historian, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Schaff" target="_blank">Philip Schaff</a>, observes this in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1602068895/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1602068895" target="_blank"><em>The Creeds of Christendom</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The genius of the Catechism is brought out at once in the  first question, which contains the central idea, and strikes the  key-note. It is unsurpassed for depth, comfort, and beauty, and, once  committed to memory, can never be forgotten. It represents Christianity  in its evangelical, practical, cheering aspect, not as a commanding law,  not as an intellectual scheme, not as a system of outward observances,  but as the best gift of God to man, as a source of peace and comfort in  life and in death. What can be more comforting, what at the same time  more honoring and stimulating to a holy life than the assurance of being  owned wholly by Christ our blessed Lord and Saviour, who sacrificed his  own spotless life for us on the cross? The first question and answer of  the Heidelberg Catechism is the whole gospel in a nutshell; blessed is  he who can repeat it from the heart and hold it fast to the end (557).

Schaff is exactly right. It is entirely worth committing this first question and answer to memory. The simple act of calling it to mind and reciting it refreshes your heart.
