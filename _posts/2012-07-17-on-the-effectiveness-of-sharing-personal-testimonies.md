<p>There have been numerous occasions when I have come across the idea  that the best 'tool' Christians have at their disposal when sharing the  gospel is their own personal testimony. The notion seems to be that  sharing this testimony is the most effective 'strategy' to employ to try  and bring people to faith in Christ. In some cases, to be sure, sharing  the story of how you came to faith and how the gospel now shapes your  life will play a role in this aim. But overall, I think this claim is  exaggerated, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>First, not all stories are equally powerful. My story, for instance,  is not in any way one of dramatic transformation. I was born and raised in a  Christian home and have believed and trusted in Christ for as long as I  can remember. There has been no radical change in my life; instead, it  has been a slow, steady journey down the road of learning to live a life  of faithfulness. I think it is fair to say that unless you are a  Christian, you will not understand the blessing of growing up as I did.  My story is increasingly unique these days in the culture I live in, but  I am well aware of, and perfectly content with, the reality that it  will not play a major role in leading anyone to faith in Jesus Christ. I  know others whose stories are entirely the opposite; they have  undergone radical transformation as they came to faith, and their  stories may have a tremendous impact on those who are not yet  Christians. But the point is simply that since everyone's story is  different, it is not accurate to say that all testimonies are equally  powerful.</p>
<p>In the second place, the <em>witness</em> of a life transformed is  much more powerful than just the verbal account of a life transformed.  Simply telling someone that the gospel has transformed your life does  not carry a lot of weight if they haven't <em>seen </em>the  transformation in your life. The two must go hand in hand. As I said  above, my story on its own won't do much to persuade people of the  transforming power of the gospel, but the witness of a life lived in  faithfulness to Christ levels the playing field. At this point it  doesn't matter whether you grew up like me or you had a radical  transformation. If we're both living faithfully, both of our lives will  look radically different to the world around us. And <em>that</em> is a powerful testimony.</p>
<p>We see this in Scripture repeatedly. The apostle Paul, for example,  testifies to the change that was worked in him by the Spirit, but that  carries weight because of the reputation that preceded him and the  significant change that occurred in his life when he came to faith.  Similarly, when God called Israel to himself in the Old Testament and  set them in the Promised Land, he placed them under his rule and gave  them a law that would shape their whole life, so that as they lived  faithfully before him, the nations around them would see how radically  different they were and come discover the God that Israel served. And  then Israel would tell of all the wondrous things the Lord had done. Or  look at the early church beginning in Acts 2 and onwards into the first  few centuries after Christ and see how their faithful living bore  witness to their commitment to the risen and ascended Lord Jesus Christ.  That is why Christianity grew so rapidly in those first centuries.</p>
<p>Third, placing so much stress on testimonies takes the focus off the  power of God's Word. In the end, that is what changes people. As they  come into contact with the proclaimed gospel, they are brought to faith  as the Spirit works in their hearts to enable them to hear and receive  that living and active Word. Emphasising the power of testimonies over  the power of the gospel also, as a result, tends to take the focus off  what God has done through Christ and instead centres in on what God has  done for an individual. While the benefits of faith in Christ are  certainly applied to individuals, the end result is not about us, but  about Jesus and his glory.</p>
<p>Finally, a testimony only speaks of the work of gospel on the  individual level. Personal transformation is, of course, very important.  But the good news of the gospel is ultimately cosmic in scope. In my  own experience, the promise that God will purify the earth from sin and  evil and restore his good creation is a promise of great encouragement  to those who are investigating Christianity. They recognise the amazing  grace of God to redeem us and to give us new life through the death and  resurrection of Christ, but they also marvel at the wonder of his  commitment to set things right again. In a world as messed up as ours,  that promise of final justice and the restoration of creation brings a  lot of hope to people. And that's something we can't convey just by  sharing a personal testimony.</p>

Those are just a few thoughts on the matter. Sharing our stories with  people while we share the gospel with them certainly has a place.  However, I do not think the idea that they are the best tool for doing  so is true. Surely the gospel itself, both proclaimed and practiced, is  the best tool for sharing the gospel.
