This is a little more of a personal reflection as I am preparing to teach the adult Sunday school class at church this weekend. I have not done a significant amount of speaking or leading discussions on biblical and theological topics. I have previously led a Bible study, a youth group, and various discussions for a couple of different groups in college. I am now assuming the leadership of a small group, and this coming Sunday will be my second time leading Sunday school at church. Usually I look forward to these opportunities. I think that God has gifted me to teach, although I maintain a very acute awareness that I continually need to learn how to teach more effectively. But every time, as I am working on the lesson for whatever I am presenting, I am struck by a number of things.

First, I am humbled. As I study in preparation for whatever it is that I might be sharing with the people gathered to hear, I am reminded of the sheer greatness and power of the Word of God. I am overtaken by the feelings that paralyzed Moses; that I am not worthy of being one who communicates the truths of God's revelation to His people.

Second, I become almost like a deer in the headlights when I think about how daunting of a task this is. People are going to listen to what I say and they are going to absorb it. That kind of reality carries a heavy burden. I am quite confident that if I surrender myself to the leading of the Spirit, I will be given the right words to speak. But I know that improper preparation and pride in my own abilities can lead to teaching things that are not biblical and potentially lead people astray. All I can do is pray that the Lord would lead me and speak through me.

Third, I myself often feel the weight of what I am teaching. For instance, I will be teaching this Sunday about what happened on the Thursday of the Holy Week, the main event of that day being Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper. This has given me opportunity to reflect again on the meaning of the Eucharist and the atoning sacrifice of Christ. In a sense, I have rediscovered the depth and the riches of His love once again. As I come to understand a little more the joy and gratitude with which we are to participate in the Supper, I only hope that I can communicate that to those whom I will be teaching.

My hope is to one day making teaching a vocation, and so I am grateful for the opportunities to do things like this. I am also grateful for being granted the discernment to be able to recognize the significance of this, and ask that God might grant me increasing wisdom as I seek to serve Him in this way. I take the words of Psalm 19:14 as my prayer:

<blockquote>
Let the words of my mouth
and the meditation of my heart
be acceptable in your sight,
O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
</blockquote>
