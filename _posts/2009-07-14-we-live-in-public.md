When exploring the relationship between the Old and New Testament, we tend to pay lip service to the idea of continuity, while in reality we conceive of it more in terms of discontinuity.  That modern evangelicalism tends to be one-dimensional does not help, nor does the great chronological distance between the era of Old Testament Israel and our own time.

But there are many important parallels to draw between then and now.  <a href="http://www.culture-making.com/about/andy_crouch/">Andy Crouch</a>, in his recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830833943?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0830833943"><span style="font-style: italic;">Culture Making: Recovering Our Creative Calling</span></a>, explores the significance of place in terms of the location God chose Israel to occupy.  The nation of Israel was at the center and heart of the Ancient Near East and was surrounded by a number of different larger and more powerful nations, each of which had direct contact and interaction with Israel.  Crouch points out that

<blockquote>
Israel's location...ensured that its unique cultural vocation would be lived out in 'public,' we might say, among the great nations of its day.  As much as Israel might have been tempted to withdraw from the larger cultural currents over the centuries of its history, it simply never had that option (128-129).
</blockquote>

To complicate matters, these larger, stronger, pagan nations exerted a great amount of cultural pressure on Israel, which found its faith constantly put to the test.  God could have chosen to isolate them instead, Crouch says, perhaps in a remote valley of the Swiss Alps or the Brazilian rainforest, "but in such a location, neither would have Israel's extraordinary claim to worship not just its own local god, but the world's very Maker and Lord, made much of a difference in the wider course of history" (129). God's design and purpose for Israel required it to be center stage, for

<blockquote>
it was only in 'public,' in the context of tremendous political and economic pressure, that Israel's cultural creativity could be made available to the neighboring nations big and small: its legal code with its keen sense of justice and responsibility toward the weak; its poetry of praise, thanksgiving and lament; its Scriptures bearing witness to the character of the one true God.  Indeed, without those cultural pressures Israel's culture might have been substantially less creative in the first place.  The exile into Babylon was the most devastating blow Israel suffered, an attempt at cultural eradication comparable to the Holocaust of the twentieth century.  But the exile forced Israel to grapple with the implications of its faith beyond its borders, to ask what faithfulness looked like in a diaspora where neither kings nor priests had majority power, to cry, 'How could we sing the Lord's song / in a foreign land?' (Ps. 137:4) and begin to find an answer (129).</blockquote>

The implications and parallels for us are clear; Crouch has a way of stating the obvious without ever actually saying it.  Although God's people find themselves in a radically different time and place today, our calling and purpose remains the same as Old Testament Israel's&mdash;to bear witness to the sovereign King of the Universe, and bring His rule to bear on all of life.  Our place, living in the midst of this world and its various cultures, does not allow us to passively withdraw.

No less than Israel, we are to be a light to the nations.  We live our lives in public.
