Every week I use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder) to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

I have missed the past month due to holidays and moving this blog over to the new host, but I am ready to pick up this weekly series again.

Here are the links from **05-11 May 2013**.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGRZKHZjfKU">Trinity Project Flythrough</a></strong> – Some students from the <a href="http://www.artdesignhull.ac.uk/">Hull School or Art and Design</a> put together this great animation and mock-up of what they imagine Trinity Square, Hull, to have looked like in AD 1349. <a href="http://www.holy-trinity.org.uk/">Holy Trinity Church</a> is being constructed at the time. They really did an excellent job.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://ti.me/115bDcW">In Battle Over Christianity, Orthodoxy Is Winning</a></strong> – An interesting piece on how, though it doesn't always look like it to us, orthodox Christianity is the only variant of Christianity that is growing. You just need to look to the South.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/115jVBv">Bread & Wine as a covenant meal</a></strong> – On his blog, <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor">Phil Whittall</a> has intriguing post on how the Lord's Supper is foreshadowed in Genesis.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZA1HBY">The New Legalism: Missional, Radical, Narcissistic, and Shamed</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/drantbradley">Anthony Bradley</a> has quite a thought-provoking post on some of the problems he perceives with the 'missional' movement. Not least is the observation that in many ways, all it really ends up being is another form of legalism.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZLvLhm">The Myth of “The Great Call”</a></strong> – This is such a helpful article, and links in with some of the things Anthony writes about above. The author's point is simple: just get on with the business of glorifying God in every area of life. That's the great call we all have.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/11c4tDI">Why Tim Keller Wants You to Stay in That Job You Hate</a></strong> – Here's a great interview <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc">Andy Crouch</a> had with Tim Keller on the subject of vocation. <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/book-review-every-good-endeavour">Keller's recent book</a> is one of the best on the subject, and the things he says in the interview are a bit of a taster if you haven't had a chance to read the book yet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bbc.in/13YZXFn">Working gun made with 3D printer</a></strong> – It's more than a little disheartening that this is one of the first things someone decided to do with a 3D printer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16lw4DB">7 benefits of having a church office</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilRobbie">Neil Robbie</a>, a vicar in West Bromwich, writes about the benefits of their newly-constructed church office. There are some good points and tips here on why a church office is a beneficial thing.</li>
