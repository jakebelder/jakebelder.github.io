Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>22-28 June 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1l3aype">N.T. Wright on Heaven and Earth, Male and Female</a></strong> – Wright recently raised a bit of a stir when a short video circulated with him discussing some of the problems behind redefining marriage, partly because of some of the analogies he used. Here is a helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> responding to and clearing up some of those misunderstandings.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1l3b3iR">Wholiness – Living Holy Lives Wholly</a></strong> – Here is a good post from <a href="http://twitter.com/chuckdegroat">Chuck DeGroat</a> on living in the freedom Christ has won for us.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iprvQf">Our Father</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> discusses how some of the references to Yahweh as 'Father' in the Old Testament, and in Isaiah in particular, can enrich our understanding of what we mean when we talk about God as Father.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Tp9qWH">A Love that Fills, and a Love that Opens</a></strong> – There is a great example here of a married couple at their wedding deliberately seeking not just to celebrate their love for one another, but for that love to reach out to their friends as well, especially those who are single and celibate.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/UBHRu2">French Lessons & Secular Indoctrination</a></strong> – Here is a really interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkRoques">Mark Roques</a> on teaching language as a Christian and how our worldview impacts how we teach different languages.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1rulqSu">Reflections on Jesus as Lord</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/mbird12">Mike Bird</a> has some reflections on the implications of Christ's Lordship over all of life, noting particularly that in some cultures where authority is often despised, this can be more difficult to grasp.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/UIZd8g">Friendship in God’s Kingdom</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> is one of the people behind the inspiring <a href="http://spiritualfriendship.org/">Spiritual Friendship</a> project, which aims at recovering a biblical vision of friendship for the flourishing of those who choose celibacy for the sake of being faithful to the Bible's teaching on marriage and sexuality. Here is an interview with him about the project.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://linkd.in/1o2CNc1">The Science Behind TED's 18-Minute Rule</a></strong> – Here are some interesting thoughts on how <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> came to decide on the 18-minute length for their talks, and the benefits of that specific length of time. There are some important things here for preachers to learn, I think.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/UMmiqI">Vicky Beeching and the sexuality debate</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> has some helpful thoughts here particularly on the forum in which the current sexuality debates are happening, and why he thinks it ought to be different.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lkBa51">A Tale of Different Funerals</a></strong> – A lot of strange things can happen at funerals, and that is because they are places that reveal what we really believe about all sorts of things, including the created order, the nature of humanity, and life and death. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1poDKzo">Hey, Church of England: if you want to become a Christian, you have to renounce the Devil</a></strong> – Some time ago, the Church of England decided to change some of the wording in the baptism liturgy, which included removing references to 'sin' and to 'the Devil'. After a lot of protest, 'sin' was put back in, but 'the Devil' remains out. There are some important points in this opinion piece on why reference to 'the Devil' needs to be put back in as well.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1pGzln5">Why Plant Churches</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/revchadbrooks">Chad Brooks</a>, who I've been connected with online for years but have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, is off to plant a new church in Sterlington, Louisiana. Why? Chad writes, "The average church plant will bring 6-8 times more new people into faith than an older congregation of the same size... Starting new churches is evangelism. If we want to introduce new people to Jesus, we have to start new churches.</li>
