Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 267px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/old%20man%20working.jpg"></div>
Since I missed last week's instalment, here are the links from <strong>12-25 May 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/10l3XQG">Phoebe, carrier of Paul’s letter to the Roman Christians</a></strong> – Phoebe, who appears in Romans 16, has always been an intriguing figure who garners significant attention, particularly in the discussion of the role of women in the church. Here is an interesting post with some observations on the role of ancient letter carriers.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/146h8Wl">Infant baptism</a></strong> – On his blog, <a href="http://twitter.com/LeeGatiss">Lee Gatiss</a> links to a few helpful resources on the subject of infant baptism from an Anglican perspective.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/10A93o5">It takes a gay atheist to say it…</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewwmason">Matthew Mason</a> posts a very, very interesting quote on the blog of the <a href="http://twitter.com/SAET_online">Society for the Advancement of Ecclesial Theology</a> from someone who is both a practising homosexual and an atheist, calling out Anglican modernists (and all liberals, really) on their pandering to public opinion.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bbc.in/10wlWnj">Retirement 'harmful to health', study says</a></strong> – This study is really not surprising, since human beings were created to work. That is an integral part of what it means to be human. It's also worth noting that, with the exception of Numbers 8:25, the Bible says nothing about retirement.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/10wBEij">Tragic Worship</a></strong> – An interesting piece by Carl Trueman on how modern worship seeks to distract us from the often tragic reality of life. There are some points to quibble with here, I think, but it is nonetheless thought-provoking.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17Sg8ZT">A Drive Around London in 1926</a></strong> – Some film footage was discovered recently that was taken – in colour! – around London in the 1920s. This is really fascinating.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13H9Gl0">Diversity, not Jesus, saves says Presiding Bishop</a></strong> – Anglican Ink reports on a 'sermon' given by Katharine Jefferts Schori in Venezuela recently. Some of the things she says are simply mind-boggling, and you might want to take a deep breath before you read this. How depressing that someone in a position of leadership in a church could wander so far from the truth.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/10LoTMF">Gay shoes & groovy bishops: no wonder young people are losing their faith</a></strong> – This opinion piece is spot on. Trying to make Christianity palatable is a sure way to kill it.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/182I4ub">Seeking Europe's Shalom</a></strong> – Here is an interesting report on how Christians can seek Europe's shalom. The report highlights that relationships play a significant role in this, and of course, that means that the church, which is inherently relational and communal, can make a huge contribution to restoring shalom.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14xmVUT">False Teachers</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWtheology">Andrew Wilson</a> has an interesting and helpful post on the <a href="http://twitter.com/thinktheology">Think Theology</a> blog about using the 'false teacher' label, one that is often thrown around carelessly.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14AoUry">A Meaningful Marriage Manifesto</a></strong> – Another great post on the <a href="http://twitter.com/thinktheology">Think Theology</a> blog on how the church needs to be clearer on what it says about marriage. <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewhosier">Matthew Hosier</a> makes a few suggestions towards a 'manifesto' that the church should subscribe to.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/10ScURK">The pattern of life in thriving communities</a></strong> – A really good article highlighting six things that we learn from the book of Acts about what a church community needs to flourish. There are some important lessons we can learn from here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13P6Nii">Imitation</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager</a> talks discipleship on his blog, noting that we need to put a bigger emphasis on the role of imitation in our discipleship and formation, imitating others and allowing others to imitate us.</li>
