<p>Since I have been posting more frequently in the past couple of months on worldview and theology and how the two are interrelated, I wanted to take some time and write a few posts fleshing out why I think theology is important.  Instead of one massive post, I am going to do a short series of three or four posts on this topic.</p>
<p>When I was younger, my grandmother gave me a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_c_sproul">R.C. Sproul's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Truths-Christian-Faith-Sproul/dp/0842320016/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228020551&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Essential Truths of the Christian Faith</span></a>. The very first line of the preface reads, "Every Christian is a theologian." Immediately it occurred to me how simple of a fact this was. I have remembered that line especially when I come across those who denounce theology as a waste of time or as an intellectual pursuit that just divides us and takes us away from the heart of Christianity.</p>
<p>It is not just because I am studying theology in seminary or because I enjoy reading and learning about it that I find it important.  Instead, I think that its importance lies in the way it informs our life, our faith, and our worldview.  Sproul, in my opinion, has it right when he says, "Sound theology...is a requisite for godly living. How can we <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> the truth without first <span style="font-style: italic;">understanding</span> what the truth is?  No Christian can avoid theology.  Every Christian has a theology."  The old maxim is absolutely true&mdash;orthodoxy begets orthopraxy.&sup1;</p>
<p>Back in September I mentioned <a href="http://jakebelder.com/framing-our-conception-of-theology">John Frame's conception of theology</a>, his basic definition being, "theology is the application of God's Word by persons to all areas of life." For Frame, theology is the task of taking the truth of Scripture and helping people see how that truth applies to all of life.  This, of course, makes it very plain that theology is not restricted to intellectuals and academics, but is an activity necessarily engaged in by every Christian.  Everything that we think, say, and do is influenced and colored by the beliefs and convictions we hold.  Our theology does not influence just our thinking about God or the Church, but also how we think about business, politics, sports, and how we use our time.  Because Christ is Lord and sovereign over all of life, every part of our life is subject to theological reflection as we work to bring it into conformity with His will.</p>
<p>If you understand theology in this way, then it follows that everything we think, say, and do is by extension the act of taking a doctrinal standpoint.  Our practice is a reflection of our understanding.  Also, if we are conscious of this, we subsequently become conscious of the great deal of hypocrisy that characterizes our lives.  It becomes clear at this point why theology is important.  Living rightly only becomes possible when we believe rightly.  As we come to a deeper understanding of Scripture, our lives become molded to the will of God and the character of Christ, equipping us more and more to live as His faithful ambassadors in this world.</p>

<span style="font-size: 85%;">&sup1;At the same time, I am well aware of the notion of <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_orandi,_lex_credendi">lex orandi/lex canendi, lex credendi</a>.  However, one simply cannot begin to praise without the basic contours of a rudimentary theology, the confession of Jesus as Lord.  From that point onward, though, it is true that our engagement in worship will lead us to deeper understanding.  Still, this does not excuse us from reflection on Scripture and theology.</span>
