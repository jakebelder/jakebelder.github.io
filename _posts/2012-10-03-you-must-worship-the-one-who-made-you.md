<p>Some of my posts in the past few months have focused on the importance of <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/all-of-life" target="_blank">the doctrine of creation in shaping how we live in this world</a>. For all that creation tells us about this, though, there is one fundamental fact that lies behind it all &ndash; namely, that God is the Creator, and thus reigns as Lord over all of his creation. <a href="http://www.rethinkingworldview.com/" target="_blank">J. Mark Bertrand</a>, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1581349343/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1581349343&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>(Re)thinking Worldview: Learning How to Think, Live, and Speak in this World</em></a>, spells out what this means for us:</p>
<blockquote>
Creation tells us something important about ourselves: who we belong to. God is omnipotent, but his right to dictate what we should and should not do comes, not from his strength, but from the fact that he made us. It is not that he has taken us by force, but that, through giving birth to us, he owns us.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
...If you know who made you, then you know whom who must worship and serve. Genesis tells us: <em>Go to the beginning, and you will find God</em>. The Old Testament adds: <em>Fear God, and you will find the beginning of wisdom</em>. In the New Testament: <em>Christ, by whom all things were made, is the wisdom of God</em>. In revealing creation, God points both to his Trinitarian nature and to the proper trajectory of a creature's life. The doctrine of creation serves not alone as an answer to the philosophical question, <em>where did I come from?</em> but also (more significantly) as the basis for our obedience in this life. There is nothing abstract, remote, or impractical about it. It is a fundamental of the faith &ndash; perhaps the fundamental, since so many other doctrines flow from it.
</blockquote>

If the doctrine of creation tells us nothing else, it tells us that we must worship the Lord of heaven and earth in everything we think, do, and say. The one who created us has created us for his praise and glory. Knowing this, and acting on it, is true wisdom. And it follows that, in ordering our life in this way, worshipping the one who made us in all areas of life, we will find the flourishing that God intends for his creatures.
