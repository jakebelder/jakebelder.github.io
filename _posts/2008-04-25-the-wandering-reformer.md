I find Peter Martyr Vermigli an intriguing figure, partly because of what Frank James says about him in the introductory essay in *Peter Martyr Vermigli and the European Reformations: Semper Reformanda*:

<blockquote>
In view of Vermigli's repeated exiles and many associations, few reformers of his stature had such a notable voice in the European Reformations. He not only allows the modern scholar to peer into the remarkable diversity of the Catholic Church (1517-1542), but equally into the diversity among Lutheran and Reformed and then more specifically, among the various versions of the Reformed branches in such places as Strasbourg, Oxford and ZÃ¼rich. This peripatetic reformer, I would argue, is an untapped medium for a better understanding of the Reformations of Europe (xxiv-xxv).
