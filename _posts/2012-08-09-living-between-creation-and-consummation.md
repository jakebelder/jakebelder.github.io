<p><a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/christ-ties-history-together" target="_blank">Earlier this week, I noted</a> how Christ ties all of history together, from creation through to consummation. The fact that these two events are integrally connected in the person of Jesus Christ, the object of our faith and worship, has significant bearing on how we live in this world. It means, on the one hand, that we must look back, recognising the signifiance of creation and how our task in the world is rooted in <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/how-the-covenant-of-creation-shapes-our-calling" target="_blank">the covenant God made with humanity at creation</a>. However, it is not enough for us to look back to creation, because creation is only a starting point for the unfolding of something much greater. The progression from creation to consummation and the unity of the whole sweep of history in Christ means that how we understand our responsibility in the world also requires us to think eschatologically.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/spykman.htm" target="_blank">Gordon Spykman</a>, in his excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802805256/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802805256" target="_blank"><em>Reformational Theology: A New Paradigm for Doing Dogmatics</em></a>, writes of the need for a biblical eschatology:</p>
<blockquote>
Biblical eschatology is...no excuse for an otherworldly retreat from our God-given callings. It does not have a negative, but a positive significance for life in the present time. The expectation of the future reinforces our present mandate. For the norms of God's Word do not change. They are the same from creation to consummation. Between God's past and his future, our present life has a provisional character. But it brings with it no new set of interim ethics which departs from the cultural mandate. We are indeed called to 'set our minds on things that are above' (Colossians 3:2), remembering, however, that this command is not structural in its thrust, telling us 'where' to live our lives, but directional, telling us 'how'/'in whose Name' to do so. The best way to seek the things above is to participate in God's mission in his world.</blockquote>
<p>Spykman's emphasis on living directionally is very important. The calling God gives us is, in one sense, very 'this-worldly'. A biblical eschatology does not seek escape from the world or live with the expectation of all of creation passing away. Otto Weber, in his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802835546/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802835546&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Foundations of Dogmatics</em></a>, recognises the dangers of such a view:</p>
<blockquote>
Without a view of the world, the Christian expectation is blind and lame, and the Christian presence is pharisaically separatistic or mystically sunken into itself. Nothing in the gospel forbids [Christians] to be faithful to life, to the earth, to culture.
</blockquote>
<p>Christ is Lord over creation and consummation, and in the person and work of Jesus God brings the former to fulfilment and completion in the latter. Right now, we live in the middle of the unfolding of that story, and our task as his people in this world is to bear witness to that reality. This is what it means to 'set our minds on things above'. <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html" target="_blank">I've written elsewhere</a> that the idea of living in the light of eternity means actively seeking to demonstrate  Christ&rsquo;s rule over all of life, offering the world around us a foretaste  of 'what is unseen' &ndash; that glorious future when the whole of creation  is redeemed and everything finds its fulfilment and flourishing under  the consummated rule of the true King.</p>

That is the essence of living between creation and consummation &ndash; keeping ourselves faithful to the creational norms revealed in God's Word, with a view to their fulfillment and ultimate realisation in the coming Kingdom. If Christ unites creation and consummation, so must we.
