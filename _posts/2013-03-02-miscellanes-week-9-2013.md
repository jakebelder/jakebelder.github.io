<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17107435" target="_blank"><strong>How do you become fluent in 11 languages?</strong></a> - This 20-year-old university student has taught himself eleven different languages, and in this video he shares a little about how he accomplished this feat. I must admit that I am envious of his abilities, and wish I had understood the value of multilingualism at an earlier age.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/22/what-evangelicals-get-wrong-about-israel-and-the-palestinians.html" target="_blank"><strong>What Evangelicals Get Wrong About Israel and the Palestinians</strong></a> - Here is an excellent article with some rare and balanced perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The author concludes, "There are two peoples with two stories, and if you want to figure out how to be a peacemaker, to take what Jesus said seriously, then it behooves you to be able to listen to the other and ask, 'What do I really need to do to be a reconciler in this very broken place?'" </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2013/02/22/why-pastors-should-read-over-their-heads/" target="_blank">Why Pastors Should Read Over Their Heads</a></strong> - There are some good points here on the importance of exercising your mind when reading. I would add that we should also make an effort to read widely, outside our own circles.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/305082529751375872/photo/1" target="_blank"><strong>Global distribution of Protestants</strong></a> - This is just an image, but it's an interesting map showing where Protestants are concentrated around the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://apologus.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/should-reformed-people-read-n-t-wright/" target="_blank"><strong>Should Reformed People Read N.T. Wright?</strong></a> - Certain people in Reformed circles are quick to dismiss Wright as heretical, but <a href="http://twitter.com/uribrito" target="_blank">Uri Brito</a> here discusses why reading Wright in particular is helpful, and why it is important in general to learn to read widely and with discernment.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fieldnotesmagazine.com/neal-paradise/youve-got-a-spiritual-gift/" target="_blank"><strong>You&rsquo;ve Got a (Spiritual) Gift</strong></a> - This post offers a helpful reminder that spiritual gifts are not just reserved for a select few. We all have gifts, and we all should use them.</li>
