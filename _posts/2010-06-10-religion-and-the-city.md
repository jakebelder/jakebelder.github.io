<p>While I was away this week, I had some time to start reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Ministry-Kingdom-City-People/dp/0830838708/ref=sr_1_1/186-4071802-1702038?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1276198838&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Urban Ministry: The Kingdom, the City &amp; the People of God</em></a>, co-authored by <a href="http://connversation.wordpress.com/harvie-conn-the-man/">Harvie Conn</a> and <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profile.html?id=20">Manuel Ortiz</a>. It really is an excellent book, although I've discovered that just reading through it is not sufficient&mdash;I am going to have to go back to the beginning armed with my trusty pencil and ruler and take the time to pore over the material and mine the gold from this thick volume.</p>
<p>One of the themes Conn and Ortiz develop in the book is that the city is a fundamentally religious place, a theme I will be looking at in the next few posts as I continue to work through the book. In ancient history, the religious character of the city was much more overt, but the more subliminal religiosity of today's cities does not obscure the fact that it still remains a fundamentally religious place. Conn and Ortiz write that in the city we find</p>
<blockquote>
urban mazes searching through the city for meaning and order to existence&mdash;quests that never escape their religious origins. With organized systems that structure religion around the supernatural, building temple and mosque. With unorganized common or folk religions that focus hopes for safe air travel in the 'spirit of the air' embodied in a straw idol and then discard it at the Kimpo airport in Seoul as the plane is boarded. With the surrogate religion of the great England bowler Harold Larwood, who claimed, 'Cricket was my reason for living.' With the unorganized invisible religion that finds its answer to the yearning of the heart in sex or ideology, work or family (191).
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is just a testament to the reality that human beings are themselves, at the core, religious beings. Conn and Ortiz cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_calvin">John Calvin</a> in the first book of his <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.i.html"><em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
God himself has implanted in all men a certain understanding of his divine majesty. Ever renewing its memory, he repeatedly sheds fresh drops...[All men] continue to retain some seed of religion. So deeply does the common conception occupy the minds of all, so tenaciously does it inhere in the hearts of all! Therefore, since from the beginning of the world there has been no region, no city, in short, no household, that could do without religion, there lies in this a tacit confession of a sense of deity inscribed in the hearts of all (I.iii.1).
</blockquote>
<p>With that in view, Conn and Ortiz ask a pressing question: "Who waits in the urban shadows of these dead-end mazeways distorted by sin, these blurred human paths along which we stumble through the city, blindly searching for links to the cosmos and its norm, to the riddle of our existence?" (191). Whoever these people are, let it be the church that shines light into those shadows, being the presence of Jesus and his Kingdom in the city. We are called as the people of God to "seek the peace and prosperity of the city" and to "pray to the Lord for it" (Jeremiah 29:7). The best thing for any city are churches that actively seek to love and serve their cities.</p>

In a place where a plethora of idols compete for its citizens hearts, in a place where meaning and purpose is distored or even lost, in a place where people's identities can be reduced to nothing, let us proclaim the message of the gospel that crushes all idols, provides total meaning and purpose, and gives people their ultimate identity as citizens of the Kingdom and children of the King.
