[Colin Gunton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Gunton), in his book, *[The One, The Three, and the Many](http://www.amazon.com/One-Three-Many-Bampton-Lectures/dp/0521421845)*, wrote:

<blockquote>
The baptized are brought into relation with God and with each other in the same act, by virtue of sharing in communion with the one Father, mediated by the Son and realized by the Spirit. Those who are in Christ are in the church: brought into relation to God and into community simultaneously.
</blockquote>
