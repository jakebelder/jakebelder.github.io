<p>We have been conversing a little about the concept of a Christian worldview here in the past while and the <a href="http://jakebelder.com/wolters-on-the-role-of-worldview">role that worldview plays in our life</a>. It has been a popular concept to talk about, and for good reason--a biblical worldview is essential to faithful living in this world. But you might recall the quote I posted from <a href="http://jakebelder.com/bertrand-rethinking-worldview">an interview with J. Mark Bertrand last week</a>, in which he said that while many had adopted the rhetoric of the worldview concept, they had not embraced the reality of it. It is not enough to simply talk about a biblical worldview. Further, I stressed the importance of <a href="http://jakebelder.com/wolters-on-the-relationship-of-worldview-to-s">rooting that worldview firmly in Scripture</a> because our beliefs must be rooted in the authority of God. Failure to do so will result in unfaithfulness and an appropriation of the beliefs of our culture.</p>
<p>In an interesting analysis, John Peck and <a href="http://www.charlesstrohmer.com/index.html">Charles Strohmer</a>, in their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Sense-Wisdom-Complex-Changing/dp/0964654342/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224173727&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Uncommon Sense: God's Wisdom for our Complex and Changing World</span></a>, point out the inconsistency between the Christians in our present Western context and the people of God of the Old and New Testament. Our culture has so effectively demarcated the ideas of "religious" and "secular" that we have accepted that divide, often unconsciously. Sometimes we confront a set of issues or ideas and automatically "assume [the Bible] has little or no distinctive wisdom for such matters." But, say Peck and Strohmer,</p>

<blockquote>
this is not the way that Jesus, or the apostles, or God's Old and New Testament people saw Scripture. They had a God who was involved in the whole of life and they had a Bible to match. For them, the Bible was not relegated to religious affairs only; it had significant instruction for what we today would call secular life (11).
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of practical ways that this separation of parts of our lives play out, and I am sure you can think of many; I will not get into listing examples. What made this divide even more problematic was that the vast majority of our lives fell into the category of secular. Everything we did from Monday through to Saturday, unless there was a Bible study at church or a prayer meeting or whatever else, properly belonged to that division and our faith had little or no bearing on what happened in the confines of those six days. Creating that dichotomy in our lives was completely influenced by how culture distinguished between secular and religious, private and public.</p>
<p>Then came that infamous "paradigm shift" here in the West, where all of a sudden our culture was possessed by a hunger for spirituality, especially fabrications of spirituality influenced by Eastern philosophy and religions. Christians were not prepared for it, because they had only just finished ironing out the distinctions between religious and secular, a pattern which still haunts us today. In the meantime, part of our culture was beginning to increasingly see things holistically and spiritually. This extremely abridged cultural analysis is only to make the point that Peck and Strohmer do: we have some catching up (or perhaps some recovering of biblical patterns) to do.</p>

<blockquote>
God has created all of life and He is equally involved in all of its parts, not just in the religious ones...we may <span style="font-style: italic;">say</span>, 'If He's not Lord of all, He's not Lord at all,' but living as if we meant it...that is another matter entirely. Our lives, as Christians, are unavoidably becoming more and more bound up with the world around us--with its culture, its thought, its science, its art, its politics, its industry, its social structures--and with its evolving new paradigm. To learn how to address this as the Bible would is the homework before us (17).
</blockquote>

<p>What we need to do, the authors contend, is to see the Bible not just as a strictly religious book, but as one that provides us with underlying wisdom to live, think, and act in our everyday life. In this way we can understand Scripture as speaking to all areas of life in a way that makes its divine authority even more meaningful and relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
We must take seriously the command to 'love the Lord your God with all your mind' in this new age, and we must do it through an acquaintance with the pages of Scripture that resonates with a wisdom that sees life as a whole and a God who is equally involved in all its parts. When we learn to do this it will make all the difference in the world (22).
</blockquote>

This wisdom is essential to challenging the spirit of this age. For this wisdom, which comes from Scripture, a wisdom rooted in the fear of the Lord, is the most crucial element in living a life that is glorifying to God. We must let His sovereignty extend to all of life.
