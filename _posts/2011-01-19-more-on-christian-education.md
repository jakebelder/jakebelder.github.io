Earlier today, I noticed that [Anthony Bradley](http://www.dranthonybradley.com/) wrote [an excellent article for World Magazine](http://online.worldmag.com/2011/01/19/a-missional-approach-to-education/) online on the opportunities available for missional churches to get involved in education in their local communities. Anthony writes, 'Outside of a church, there is no better way, institutionally speaking, to demonstrate love for our neighbors than to provide education that surpasses failing public schools in quality and virtue, especially in inner cities.'

There are huge opportunities here for churches to play an active role in the renewal of the city and to help bring children up understanding reality through the lens of the Gospel. Check out this video below to learn about the incredible work that is being done in Philadelphia by Christians who are committed to Christian education and the people in their communities.
