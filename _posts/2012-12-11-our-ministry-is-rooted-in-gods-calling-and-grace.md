<p>After many, many months, I have finally finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Willimon" target="_blank">William Willimon's</a> excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0687045320/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0687045320" target="_blank"><em>Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry</em></a>. He draws the book to a close by reminding pastors that their ministry is rooted in God's calling and grace. Were it not, we would not be able to go on. Says Willimon,</p>
<blockquote>
If God does not mean for us to be here &ndash; preaching, teaching, visiting, counseling, speaking the truth &ndash; then ministry is utter misery. Burnout, brownout, dissipation of energy and commitment, are matters more of distress than stress, a lack of meaning rather than a lack of energy... The ordained ministry is not a profession, not a path to personal advancement or private contentment. The pastorate is a vocation...a call, a summons from God, an assignment to a work that we could not, would not, take up on our own... To know that we are here, in ministry, because God wills us to be here &ndash; this is great grace (326).

<p>There are, of course, a plethora of articles and books written on the subject of pastors and stress, but many of these focus on dealing with stress at a practical level. Helpful as those may be, Willimon here suggests that this is not the root of the problem. At base, the problem is a lack of confidence in the reality that God is at work in us and in the church. He is the one who calls and equips us for ministry, and he is the one who works in the hearts and lives of those under our care, transforming them by his Spirit into the image of Christ. When we forget that, we will begin to rely on our own strength for a task that we are utterly incapable of doing on our own. In order to keep going, to press on, we need to renew that confidence in God's work in and through us:</p>
<blockquote>
[Pastors] keep going, even without many tangible results and rewards, because of our faith that God wills for the church to ultimately triumph... The only way to keep at ministry amid all the pastoral challenges is from the conviction that God really is present &ndash; in Word and Sacrament, in our work of ministry, as a treasure in earthen vessels &ndash; bringing all things unto God, despite us, through us, for us. God with us. Yes, God with <em>us</em> (333).
</blockquote>

This echoes the words of Paul in 2 Corinthians 3, where he writes that our confidence in ministry comes 'through Christ before God. We are not competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God' (2 Cor. 3:4-5). What a great comfort this is!
