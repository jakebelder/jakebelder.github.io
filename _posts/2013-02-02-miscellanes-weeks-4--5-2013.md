<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Since I was out of town last Saturday, here are the links from <strong>20 January-02 February 2013</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2013/01/teaching-historical-sense-to-a.php" target="_blank"><strong>Teaching Historical Sense to a Sophisticated and Discerning Lady (Aged 7)</strong></a> - Here's a good post from Carl Trueman on why evangelicalism needs to cultivate a historical consciousness, with some practical tips on how to do so, including amongst children.</li>
<li><a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/blogs/culture/a-surprising-consensus" target="_blank"><strong>A surprising consensus?</strong></a> - Michael Jensen, a Sydney Anglican, observes that, in the wake of the publication of the three small e-books from Zondervan on women's ministry, there is an increasing recognition that the 'New Testament features women in speaking roles in front of mixed  congregations to a far greater extent than is often now practiced in  Sydney Anglican churches.' Considering the source, I find this interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/january-february/faith-in-fallen-empire.html?paging=off&amp;buffer_share=d3585&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Faith in a Fallen Empire</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> keeps publishing some excellent stuff, and here is a very encouraging story of Christians working for the renewal and flourishing of the city of Detroit. This is a beautiful portrait of what it looks like to love your city.</li>
<li><a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/crooked-healing-disability-vocation-and-the-theology-of-the-cross/" target="_blank"><strong>Crooked Healing: Disability, Vocation &amp; the Theology of the Cross</strong></a> - Alastair Roberts hosted a guest post on his blog this week on a theology of disability. The whole post is very interesting, but I found the notion of disability as vocation particularly interesting, especially the idea that 'an individual&rsquo;s disability is, subversively, a venue for Christ to display his glory.'</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/For-40-Years-This-Russian-Family-Was-Cut-Off-From-Human-Contact-Unaware-of-World-War-II-188843001.html" target="_blank">For 40 Years, This Russian Family Was Cut Off From All Human Contact</a></strong> - In 1978, Soviet geologists exploring part of Siberia, came upon a family that had been living in a hut alone for over forty years, nearly 150 miles from the nearest human settlement. This is an absolutely fascinating story.</li>
<li><a href="http://ergofabulous.org/luther/" target="_blank"><strong>Lutheran Insulter</strong></a> - Martin Luther was known for his rather creative insults, and if you have ever wanted to be on the receiving end of one of those insults, now you can. This is rather amusing.</li>
<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5979758/why-you-should-work-from-a-coffee-shop-even-when-you-have-an-office" target="_blank"><strong>Why You Should Work From a Coffee Shop, Even When You Have an Office</strong></a> - I always enjoy working from coffee shops, and it was nice to discover that there are a number of good reasons for doing so.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/leithart/2013/01/31/islam-and-jesus/" target="_blank"><strong>Islam and Jesus</strong></a> - Peter Leithart notes, 'More Muslims have committed to follow Christ in the last 10 years than in the last 15 centuries of Islam.' Wow.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/01/31/parents-let-your-teens-be-adults/" target="_blank"><strong>Parents, Let Your Teens Be Adults</strong></a> - This is good. I've long believed that adolescence is a social construct and that we need to stop forcing immaturity and instead encourage children to grow up faster.</li>
