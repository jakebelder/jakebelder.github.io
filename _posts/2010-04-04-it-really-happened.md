<p><em><a href="http://www.leithart.com/about/">Peter Leithart</a> posted the following entry on the <a href="http://www.credenda.org/">CREDENDAagenda</a> website the other day, and I wanted to post it here because it is probably the best reflection on the Holy Week that I've read. I know I could have just linked to the post, but it really is so good that I wanted to have it here as well. Happy Easter. He is Risen!<br /></em></p>
<p>It really happened.</p>
<p>Some 2000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth died on a Roman cross outside Jerusalem and was  placed in a nearby tomb.&nbsp; On the third day after His death, women came  to the tomb to dress the body and found the tomb empty, heard from  angels that Jesus had risen from the dead, and shortly after encountered  Jesus Himself.&nbsp; Then Jesus appeared to His disciples, and to many  others.</p>
<p>It really happened.</p>
<p>Romans and Jews conspired to give alternative explanations of the  empty tomb from the first, and alternative explanations keep coming.&nbsp;  None of the alternative explanations works.&nbsp; None of them can explain  the rise of early Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus, the  persistence of belief in Jesus in the face of massive murderous threats,  the dramatic change in the disciples that took place after Easter and  Pentecost.</p>
<p>The only plausible explanation is that Jesus rose from the dead.&nbsp; The  only explanation that fits the evidence is that it really happened.</p>
<p>And if it really happened, then the world is a very different place  than we might have thought.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then the world is the kind of place where  there is not only life after death, a disembodied existence in heaven,  but what N.T. Wright calls &ldquo;life after life after death,&rdquo; embodied life  in a new heavens and new earth.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then the post-Enlightenment effort to explain  the world by scientific naturalism will never be successful.&nbsp; Things  have happened that our science cannot explain, and there is more in  heaven and earth than are dreamed of in philosophy.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then the power of tyrants is shattered.&nbsp; The  worst the tyrant can do is kill.&nbsp; The power of tyranny is the power of  death. But if death is reversible, if dead people do come back to life  after life after death, then the tyrant&rsquo;s sword is finally useless and  certainly not fearsome.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then Jesus is who He always said He was, the  Son of God, the King who would sit on the throne of David.</p>
<p>If it really happened, Jesus is sitting on that throne right now,  ruling all things.&nbsp; He is the new <em>kurios</em>, the new world ruler,  the new emperor, to whom all principalities and powers are called to  submit.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then the universe is being governed by Jesus,  and there is no corner of the globe, no edge of the universe, where He  is not king.&nbsp; Nothing is outside His rule, and we have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>If it really happened, we have been given a preview of the end of the  age.&nbsp; Jews believed that resurrection was an event of the end, which it  is.&nbsp; But the end has already begun.&nbsp; Jesus has been raised, the  firstfruits of the resurrection, and that means that the end has come.&nbsp;  The end will be resurrection, restoration, a new creation.&nbsp; The end will  not be disembodied spirits in a disembodied world.&nbsp; The end will be  this world transfigured into the new creation, into a new heavens and  new earth.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then no situation and no person are hopeless.&nbsp;  No marriage is beyond repair, no child beyond recovery, no pagan beyond  the reach of the gospel, no sin beyond forgiveness, no womb permanently  sealed, no one and nothing beyond restoration.</p>
<p>If it really happened, giving up is simply not an option, because if  bodily death is reversible, so are all the other little deaths that we  suffer in life.&nbsp; If it really happened, hope is not a delusion, but the  driving power of abundant life.</p>
<p>If it really happened, then we've got a load of work, because not  everyone has heard the news that God has conquered death.&nbsp; Jesus is King  and Lord, and He sends us out to announce that He rule.&nbsp; He establishes  the church to be the first form and bearer of His kingdom.&nbsp; He intends  to overcome all evil and sin, all injustice and wickedness, and calls us  in the power of His resurrection to share in His war against all that  damages His good creation.</p>
<p>Go to the darkest shanty town of the darkest city on the darkest  continent, and there too the Risen Jesus is king.&nbsp; Wade into the waste  of the most ruined life, and there too Jesus is the Living Lord.&nbsp; Sort  through the wreckage your own sin has caused in your own life, face it  in faith and hope, and you will see resurrection life at work through  the Spirit, and the liberating power of God's forgiveness.</p>

Because it happened.&nbsp; It really happened.
