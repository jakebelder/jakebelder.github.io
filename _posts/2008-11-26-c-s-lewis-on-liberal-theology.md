[C. S. Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.s._lewis), from his *[Christian Reflections](http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Reflections-C-S-Lewis/dp/0802808697/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1227727002&sr=8-1)*:

<blockquote>
All theology of the liberal type involves at some point...the claim that the real behavior and purpose and teaching of Christ came very rapidly to be misunderstood and misrepresented by his followers, and has been recovered or exhumed only by modern scholars.
</blockquote>

Thoughts?
