[Peter Hitchens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hitchens) was a guest on the Australian television programme *[Q&A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%26A_%28Australian_talk_show%29)* (which seems to be their equivalent of the BBC's *Question Time*) last week, part of a special episode called the 'Festival of Dangerous Ideas', in which participants engage with some of the most significant issues in culture at the moment. You can watch the whole program [here](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s3868791.htm), although I couldn’t get through the first ten minutes – most of the other panellists waste no time in demonstrating that they are unable to have a sensible conversation, and [Dan Savage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_savage) in particular is unnecessarily rude and vulgar.

However, Hitchens' final comments on what he believes to be the single most dangerous idea in human history make the last few minutes of the episode worth watching:

[Jaroslav Pelikan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Pelikan) said it best: 'If Christ is risen, nothing else matters. And if Christ is not risen – nothing else matters.'
