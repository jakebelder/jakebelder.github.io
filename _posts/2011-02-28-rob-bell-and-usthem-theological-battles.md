<p>By now, there is no way you have missed the controversy about <a href="http://www.robbell.com/">Rob Bell's</a> new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Wins-About-Heaven-Person/dp/006204964X/">Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived</a>.</em>&nbsp;The internet nearly exploded on Saturday when <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2011/02/26/rob-bell-universalist/">Justin Taylor posted a rather unhelpful piece</a>&nbsp;essentially declaring Bell to be apostate for rejecting the idea of hell and embracing universalism. Taylor wisely amended his post soon afterward and noted that he had made his judgments without actually reading the book. Nonetheless, folks all over took Taylor's post to be the truth, and immediately proceeded to toss Bell aside as a heretic.</p>

<p>My knowledge of Bell's theology is limited, but I know that he has been a controversial figure for quite some time. Robin, my wife, is from Grand Rapids, and during the time we were dating we went to <a href="http://marshill.org/">Bell's church</a> a couple of times, although for all the ink spilled about his bad theology, I never heard him say anything overtly unbiblical. Nonetheless, I was not surprised to see his name dragged through the mud again for his views on how God deals with those who reject him.</p>
<p>I was not surprised, but I was very disappointed. We always need to have an enemy, it seems, and Rob Bell made the perfect target this weekend. And so without having read his book or interacted with him on the issue at hand, people all over set to judging him and condemning what they think they knew of his theology.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Peterson">Eugene Peterson</a>, in <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/6787/nm/Practice+Resurrection%3A+A+Conversation+on+Growing+Up+in+Christ+%28Hardcover%29?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Practice Resurrection</a></em>,&nbsp;spends a few pages discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber">Martin Buber's</a> book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Thou-Martin-Buber/dp/0684717255">I and Thou</a>. </em>Buber puts forth the theory that there are three ways humans typically approach their relationships with others:&nbsp;<em>I-It</em>, which objectifies the other in the relationship;&nbsp;<em>Us-Them</em>, which divides every relationship into good and bad; and <em>I-You</em>, which recognises the personality and humanity of each person in the relationship. Having the Bell controversy on my mind as I read this, I was struck by how often evangelicals view everything through the lens of <em>Us-Them</em>. Peterson summarises Buber's second category like this:</p>
<blockquote>
Us-Them: the world is divided into two, the children of light and the children of darkness. This is a very convenient way to think about the world because whatever is wrong, it's obviously because of 'them.' Complexities vanish. Everything is suddenly tidy. There are goats and sheep, and the sheep by the very nature of things will triumph &ndash; didn't Jesus say so? Us-Them has always attracted demagogues, and the demagogues have attracted great crowds. This in effect demonizes everyone who doesn't think or feel along the lines of Us... Us-Them turns others into the enemy.
</blockquote>
<p>I am not here to defend Bell's theology or to offer an apology for his book. And if you do a quick Google search, you will find lots of helpful (and not so helpful) responses already written about what happened this weekend. But the whole controversy brings to light again the need for Christians to stop glorying in ugly theological battles, <em>especially</em>&nbsp;when our understanding of the theology we are opposing is based on speculation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=502">John Frame</a>, one my seminary professors, had such wisdom and humility in <a href="http://jakebelder.com/frame-interacting-with-the-thought-of-others">how he dealt with the thought of others</a>, particularly those he disagreed with. I learned a great deal from him about this. We have a responsibility to have a thorough understanding of the thinking of those we disagree with before we set out to critique them. And when we do, <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Eph%204#q=&amp;ref=Eph%204&amp;ver=NIV">Ephesians 4</a> is instructive, because our critique of the theology of others is not to tear them down, but to build them &ndash; and the whole body of Christ &ndash; up. So we must speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). What's more, we simply cannot be so casual when it comes to throwing around accusations of a false gospel. To be sure, we have a responsibility to carefully evaluate the teaching of others, and sometimes there will be a need to be frank and honest about someone teaching a false gospel. But to label someone apostate is a <em>major</em>&nbsp;charge, one that has immense implications. We are wise to use this label very sparingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was largely absent from the internet discussions over the weekend. It is a lot easier to label someone apostate than to take the time to interact with their thought. But this hardly serves to build up the body of Christ.</p>

I don't know what Rob Bell thinks about hell or universalism or how God deals with those who reject him. If the promotional video that caused so much of a stir is accurate, then there are some major theological issues that need to be addressed. But writing off Bell as a heretic or bidding him farewell should not be our first reaction. We need to carefully evaluate Bell's theology, interact with him about these issues, and speak the truth in love. Don't revel in division and controversy. Seek the unity and peace of Christ's church.
