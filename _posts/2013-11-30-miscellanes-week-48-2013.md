Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 267px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/celebrity_pastor_redcarpet.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>24-30 November 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hcHgaN">Spiritual Friendship at Biola</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> gave this helpful talk at Biola University a few months ago on the idea of spiritual friendship. He's calling for a recovery of an ancient practice of friendship that creates something much deeper and more lasting than our modern friendships. The talk is very enlightening and helpful, and is especially important if the church is going to help those who are single or required to practice celibacy be faithful and enjoy the fullness of deep, intimate relationships.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jA7T6d">Hughes Oliphant Old on Anabaptism</a></strong> – This is a very intriguing post, particularly in light of the 'resurgence' of Calvinism amongst evangelicals. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Oliphant_Old">Old's</a> research seems to show that you can't easily claim Reformed soteriology if you're not willing to accept Reformed sacramentology. The two go hand-in-hand.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1c6kcXj">Leonardo Da Vinci's wacky piano is heard for the first time, after 500 years</a></strong> – Apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> once designed an instrument that is kind of a cross between a cello and a piano, but never built it. Now someone has, and you can hear what it sounds like. I would love to have a go on this thing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cyue1L">If the Top Men Take Over, Who Will Ask The Hard Questions? </a></strong> – <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html">Carl Trueman</a> has offered several helpful critiques of the celebrity movement in American evangelicalism, and he nails it here once again. The big issue he addresses this time is accountability and the reality that celebrities are increasingly doing and getting away with things that they shouldn't as their followers just continue to rally behind them.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ihHD58">A Process for Sermon Development</a></strong> – Here is an interesting and helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/JonTyson">Jon Tyson</a> on preparing and preaching sermons. He offers some particularly helpful advice on how to address those who are not believers, as well as how to make solid applications that will grow and mature the community of believers.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.peter-ould.net/2013/11/28/pilling-bishop-of-birkenheads-dissenting-statement/">Pilling – Bishop of Birkenhead's Dissenting Statement</a></strong> – The <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/marriage,-family-and-sexuality-issues/human-sexuality/pilling-report.aspx">Pilling Report</a> was released this week, which had been commissioned by the Church of England to study sexuality and particularly the question of same-sex relationships. The results of the study are (predictably?) disappointing, and you can find good responses all over the place (<a href="http://www.peter-ould.net/2013/11/28/pilling-two-thoughts/">here</a>, <a href="http://admiralcreedy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/when-this-is-brief-guide-to-pilling.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.evangelicals.org/news.asp?id=1630">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.pastortheologians.com/a-bitter-pilling-to-swallow/11/">here</a>, to begin with). Positively, however, the Bishop of Birkenhead, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Sinclair_%28bishop%29">Keith Sinclair</a>, has not signed the statement, and published an extensive statement on why he could not do so in good conscience. This is a bold and courageous move, and his desire to be faithful to Scripture is so encouraging.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.livingout.org">Living Out</a></strong> – This is a new website launched just this week by a number of people who struggle with same-sex attraction, but are striving to be faithful to God's design for sexuality. The website has stories, questions, and resources on Christianity and same-sex attraction, and will be so helpful in encouraging others to be faithful in the same way. Again, a bold and courageous move for the good of the church, especially in light of the Pilling Report.</li>
