Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 276px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/people_dining.jpg" width="400"></div>
Here are the links from the week of <strong>14-20 September 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/X5O3eo">A Book I’d Like to Write (or At Least Read)</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> says he might like to 'write a book for a mainstream press that tries to explain to a skeptical audience what it’s like to hold a traditional Christian sexual ethic. An insider’s report, so to speak, for traditional religion’s puzzled and interested observers'. I think he is right that something like this would be very helpful.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/X5OfdL">Leave none alive</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor">Phil Whittall</a> compiles a helpful list of resources on the whole question of God and genocide.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZmrUKF">Should Sermons Be Published?</a></strong> – In a day where recording and publishing sermons is almost ubiquitous, <a href="http://twitter.com/jake_meador">Jake Meador</a> has a really interesting and thoughtful post questioning that practice. There is lots to think about here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1q784IB">Table Manners: Why We Take Communion Every Week</a></strong> – Good overview piece in <em>Christianity Today</em> on the importance of Holy Communion. Nothing new, of course, but as it is written for a primarily (American) evangelical audience, it's good to see them running pieces like this.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1tXYyyR">Agents of New Creation</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> discusses how Christians give light to, form, and fill the world, modelling the pattern of God's creative acts.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Xac2sU">Parenting in the Spirit</a></strong> – Another post from Peter Leithart, who here says, 'If you want your family to flourish, make sure your family is a Pentecostal family.' What he means by that is that we need to parent in the Spirit – seeking to be filled by the Spirit through prayer, through the Word, at the Table, and by putting to death that which grieves the Spirit.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1r1oEid">The Lavishness of Friendship and a World Beyond Vows</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> wrote <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/september/why-cant-men-be-friends-wesley-hill-friendship.html">the cover story for the recent edition of <em>Christianity Today</em></a>, and here <a href="http://twitter.com/mattleeanderson">Matthew Lee Anderson</a> interacts with some of Wesley's points, raising what I think is an interesting conversation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/XtKGhF">What does it mean to be ‘lost’?</a></strong> – A very interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> on the language we use to talk about those who are not Christians. There is much to talk and think about here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/YXTUEn">Church Planting Is Extending Eden</a></strong> – I am going to blog a response to this post next week, but for now, I'll simply point out that there is a lot of theological confusion here, particularly in the narrow view of mission and in a misunderstanding of the creational mandate. <br><span style="font-size:small"><strong>(Update 25/09/2014:</strong><em> I've decided not to respond to this article, partly because of time constraints, and partly because I've said much of what I would say in response before on this blog.)</em></span></li>
