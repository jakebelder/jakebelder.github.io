Rousseau's statement has some elements of truth to it, but the reason he believed man to be enslaved does not. Consider this quote I heard today in a sermon:

<blockquote>
The chains of sin are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.
</blockquote>

That's a powerful thought. The guy who preached the sermon used the book of Judges to illustrate this in a very real way. Israel went through a vicious cycle of disobedience to God, punishment by subjection to other nations, deliverance at the hand of a judge, following God, and then starting all over again once the judge died. Israel's cycle is much like our own. Too often we try to break the chains by simply correcting a behavior.

But that doesn't do it. We need to look to our hearts and ask the Spirit to reveal the sin or idolatry that is buried deep inside of it. That is what needs to be eradicated. Israel only corrected the behavior when trouble came. Their heart remained devoted to something else. That is why they eventually went into exile. The book of Proverbs speaks extensively of how a sinful heart can be disguised, yet God knows the heart. Eventually, what is in our hearts is revealed. The stories are in the Bible, though, for us to learn from. Just like Israel, we remain sinful in nature. But the grace of Jesus covers us and makes us pure. When we seek after God, he draws close to us. His Holy Spirit lives in us that we might be able to conquer sin and make our hearts right and pure. The chains will only be broken when our hearts are right with God.
