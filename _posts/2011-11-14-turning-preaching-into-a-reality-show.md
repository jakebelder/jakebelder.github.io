<p>Over the weekend, I was made aware that <a href="http://www.marshill.com">Mars Hill Church</a> in Seattle is hosting a preaching contest tomorrow to determine who will fill in for lead pastor Mark Driscoll on weeks that he is not preaching. Like those who pointed me to the news, I was hoping it was a joke. But it's not. The description on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=231138190282770">Facebook event page</a> reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Tuesday, November 15th from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., we'll be hosting our first  ever Preaching Qualifying School (Q School) at Mars Hill Ballard. This  event will be a pressure-cooker preaching competition a la American Idol  between 3 Mars Hill elders with the prize of being part of our  preaching rotation to fill the pulpit on weeks Pastor Mark is out of the  pulpit. <br /> <br />

The three candidates are:<br />
Pastor Thomas Hurst of Mars Hill Bellevue<br />
Pastor Scott Mitchell of Mars Hill Everett<br />
Pastor AJ Hamilton of Mars Hill Albuquerque<br /> <br />

Judging the candidates will be:<br />
Pastor Mark Driscoll (playing the part of Simon Cowell&mdash;minus the v-neck)<br />
Pastor Justin Holcomb<br />
Pastor Dave Bruskas<br />
Pastor Scott Thomas<br /> <br />

Emceeing and playing the part of Ryan Seacrest will be Pastor Tim Gaydos of Mars Hill Downtown Seattle.<br /> <br />

We're hoping to get a big crowd of folks to come cheer on these guys  and make a event of it. So, come on by and cheer on your favorite  contestant.

<p>It's hard to know where to begin with this, but a few things immediately come to mind. First, the use of the phrase 'a la American Idol' is obviously not arbitrary because the aim of this exercise is to see who will preach the most like Mark Driscoll. He is really the standard against which these other preachers are being judged. If that were not the case, they'd simply put together a rotation of preachers to fill the slots.</p>
<p>Second, and more signifcantly, holding an event like this speaks volumes about the theology of preaching at work here. This is what concerns me most. For one, when you pit three preachers against each other like this and turn it into a spectacle, all the weight and responsibility of the task of preaching is removed. No longer is your concern to address the spiritual needs of the congregation and to apply the Word to the specific context you're ministering in, but it's to impress four men who are determining whether or not you'll get a chance to preach in the most prestigious pulpit in the Mars Hill world. Needless to say, the dynamics of preaching in such an environment will completely alter how these three guys preach.</p>
<p>What's more, the church is making a public declaration in judging between the 'contestants' that one preacher is better than the other two. What will happen as a result is that a very low view of preaching will be fostered among the members of the church because they are being taught that it is more worthwhile to listen to one preacher than another.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, this is disastrous for the ministry of the Word. Believers need to have the conviction that, when the Bible is expounded faithfully in the pulpit, God is speaking through the preacher, regardless of whether or not he is as animated, humourous, or gripping as another preacher. Without that conviction, they will not come before the preached Word with humility. They will approach preaching with the consumeristic mindset of our culture, only giving ear to the preacher who entertains and captivates them most.</p>
<p>There is much more that could be said about this, but for now, all I hope is that Mars Hill recognises these problems and cancels this event.</p>

Preaching is not a game or a contest. It is serious business.
