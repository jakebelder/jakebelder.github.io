Several years ago, I emailed <a href="http://cpjustice.org/gideonstrauss/">Gideon Strauss</a>&mdash;friend, former professor, and recently appointed director of the <a href="http://cpjustice.org/">Center for Public Justice</a>&mdash;asking for some advice on how to read better. Below, slightly edited and abridged, is his reply:

<blockquote>
I have three 'secrets':<br /><br>
<ol>
<li>I am almost always reading.  I'd guess I am busy with about five books at any given time.  I always have a novel on the go, for two reasons: novels calm me and comfort me, and novels are like reading speed exercise equipment for me&mdash;when I read novels, my reading speed goes way up. This is true for the non-novel reading I am doing as well.  I read whenever I can get an opportunity&mdash;other than movies on DVD, I watch <span style="font-style: italic;">no</span> television.  I scan a lot of magazines and web stuff, and I am always looking out for books on the many topics that interest me.  I put an enormous amount of books on hold at the library via their internet catalogue.</li>
<li>I scan most books quickly, and I retain a lot of what I've scanned.  So I'd look at the inside cover summary, the contents page, the introduction and the conclusion.  Only if it really, really grips me will I read more than that.</li>
<li>If I am going to read a non-novel book thoroughly, then I make a real performance of it.  I buy my own copy, I fold and mutilate the pages, I underline and annotate the book in pen, and then I write down the best bits (summaries, quotes, references, etc.) on 4x6 cards that I store in little boxes for future reference.  Very few books get this treatment.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Over the last few years, I have found his suggestions very helpful, although I've employed them with varying degrees of success.  And if I am going to get really involved in a book, I wouldn't fold pages or use pen to make notes (I prefer post-it notes and a 0.7mm pencil), but that is just personal preference.

What do you think?  Are these helpful suggestions?  Do you have any additional tips that you use when reading?
