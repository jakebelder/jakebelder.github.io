Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<strong>Please note:</strong> This will be the last instalment in the <em><a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/miscellanes">Miscellanées</a></em> series. I simply don't have the time to continue to put this post together each week. From here forward, all the links I share on Twitter will also be posted to <a href="http://jakebelder.tumblr.com">a new Tumblr blog</a>, and archived there. A link for the Tumblr site appears in the menu bar above.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>19-25 October 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZCjVss">Hallowe'en is Coming: some thoughts</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Sadgrovem">Michael Sadgrove</a> muses on whether there is still a place for Hallowe'en. An interesting post.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1yRgKwl">33 thoughts on reading</a></strong> – Some great thoughts on how to make the most of the reading experience. This is a manifesto I can very happily get behind.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1s1lbMs">10 reasons why you shouldn't have a church website</a></strong> – In a day where conventional wisdom seems to be that a good website is crucial for a church to have, this is a very interesting post.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1re29mW">The gospel and telepathy</a></strong> – This is fun: "Preach the gospel at all times. Use words if you're unable to communicate telepathically."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1rdB2Z1">An Extraordinary Synod, Indeed</a></strong> – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Weigel">George Weigel</a> has some interesting insights on the recent Roman Catholic Synod on the Family that took place in Rome earlier this month, which he says was quite extraordinary in a number of ways..</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1sNYI9m">Reading Wendell Berry at Costco</a></strong> – This article is a review of <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith's</a> latest book, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1xWdxeo">How (Not) to be Secular</a></em>, but also offers some really helpful insight into Smith's thought, as the reviewer draws from a number of his recent writings.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1yk0DEw">A Tale of Two Deaths</a></strong> – A brilliant piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/mattleeanderson">Matthew Lee Anderson</a> on the sacredness of life and courage in facing death: "To choose death, even when death is inevitable, is a fundamental betrayal of the sacredness of life. It is a concession to the enemy, not a triumph over it: it claims for itself ‘dignity,’ but it is a false dignity that comes from binding oneself to that which destroys human life."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ynXEuS">The Death of the Parish</a></strong> – Here is a thoughtful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a> on how our use of cars has impacted our ecclesiology.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgpjIq">Loving the Hunt: Kuyper on Scholarship and Stewardship</a></strong> – This is a good post on why in scholarship, among other things, it can't always just be about the end results. The process of inquiry is just as important.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1wjyYWh">Seeking self or costly discipleship? Standing with the persecuted</a></strong> – Another great post from this week from <a href="http://twitter.com/ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a>: "At the moment, [Christians in the global south] need us to stand in solidarity with them, and we will not do so credibly if we have accepted a faith that downplays the path of obedience to a God who claims the totality of our lives as his own. It is just possible that the best antidote to a peculiarly western religion focused on the self is to open our eyes and ears to our persecuted brothers and sisters overseas."</li>
