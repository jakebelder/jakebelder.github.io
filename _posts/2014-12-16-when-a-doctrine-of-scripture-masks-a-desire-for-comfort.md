Several times in the past few months I have been involved in discussions on the role Scripture plays in theological reflection. Prior to one of those discussions, we read [an interesting paper](http://essential.metapress.com/content/38n3211v762784k7/) by [Roger Walton](http://twitter.com/rogerwalton), a Methodist leader in West Yorkshire, who did some research into the different ways the Bible was used by theology students in various contexts. He ended up producing a taxonomy of about seven different methods students employed, one of which was what we commonly call proof-texting. In its worst form, it is a method that takes a few verses from here and there to prove a theological point, without any reference to context. At the risk of generalising, accusations of ‘proof-texting’ are most often lobbed by liberal theologians at those who take a more conservative approach to Scripture and theology.<sup>1</sup>

Proof-texting has a bad name, and even mentioning the word will cause many people to sneer. Indeed, it is often a method employed poorly. But the question I wanted to ask in these discussions was, does that mean we ought to write off proof-texting altogether? Is there *never* a place for that kind of literal use of Scripture, where we can simply say, ‘The Bible says…’?

Warnings against proof-texting often accompany the argument that a doctrine of Scripture needs to be properly nuanced. Certainly, having a robust doctrine of Scripture is important for theology, and we need to work hard to understand the nature and authority of the revelation God has given to us. But I think there comes a point when we put too much stress on the idea of ‘nuance’. In my more cynical moments, I begin to wonder if those who say, ‘We need to be more nuanced in our use of Scripture’ are actually saying, ‘I need to find a way to make Scripture say what I want it to.’

The December issue of *[Christianity Today](http://www.christianitytoday.com/)* carries [a profile of Pope Francis](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/december/pop-francis.html) authored by [R.R. Reno](http://twitter.com/rr_reno), and one of the things Reno notes is that people are drawn to Francis because of his literalism, particularly in his embrace of poverty. ‘The literalism of Francis,’ Reno writes, ‘makes immediate the commands of God.’ Because Francis is a Roman Catholic, and I am not, there is much I disagree with him on, but in terms of his desire to live faithfully, he is an important example. He does not spend all kinds of time engaged in academic scholarship trying to figure out what exactly Jesus *really* means when he says something. Instead, Francis reads the Bible, hears the commands of Jesus, and obeys immediately, in this case seeking to embrace the calling to humility, generosity, and love. That is a type of proof-texting. ‘The Bible says…’ and he does. And while some people scoff at this literalism, it is something that draws many more people to Francis because in those actions, they are pointed to Christ.

The more I hear about ‘nuanced’ doctrines of Scripture, the more I think we have replaced the call to be conformed to Christ with a desire to be conformed to comfort. We cover that up by saying that we are so far removed from the original context or that the text of Scripture has been corrupted over time, that we need to engage in all kinds of study and scholarship to get at what Jesus really said.

By no means am I saying that all scholarship is bad or that the hidden agenda of every theologian is to evade Jesus' words. As someone currently embedded in an academic theological environment, the work done in these sorts of contexts is often very important and valuable. If I did not believe that, I would not be doing the kind of work I'm doing. But I am also aware that when we are not watching our hearts, this kind of thing can become a convenient means of finding a Jesus who will allow us to live in a way that does not provoke hostility from the world around us. It’s worth noting, [as I’ve pointed out recently, that inconsistencies here are blindingly obvious to some atheists](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/when-atheists-know-how-to-be-better-christians-than-we-do), and a serious hindrance to our witness.

A desire to always avoid more literal readings of Scripture carries with it an implication that we have a God who is no longer trustworthy and faithful. If God has decided to reveal himself in Scripture, would he really allow that revelation to get so corrupted that only the most academically astute amongst us could figure out what the Bible really says? If loving God means keeping his commands (1 John 5:3), would he allow Scripture to change to the degree that it would be nearly impossible for us to simply read it and discover those commands?

If this makes me sound like a ‘fundamentalist’, then so be it. I want a robust and healthy doctrine of Scripture as much as the next person, but we need to be serious about what is going on in our hearts. The fact is that following Jesus is hard, [sometimes it even hurts](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/sometimes-faithfulness-hurts), and we don’t like that. Our hesitation to take Jesus at his word, to obey immediately, exposes the weakness of our faith and our failure to believe that he really does know what’s best for us.

Following Jesus will bring trouble in this world, yes, but he has overcome the world (John 16:33). Because we have died with him and been raised to new life with him (Romans 6:4, 2 Corinthians 5:17), Christ now lives in us (Galatians 2:20). And that means that however much the world mocks us, hates us and persecutes us (which it will, Matthew 10:22), we will be able to follow Jesus with all our heart and know the joy of living as he has called us to. That is a joy we miss out on when we are more concerned with the pursuit of happiness and comfort. What's more, just as Pope Francis' literalism is what endears him to so many people, when we embrace the joy of living in faithfulness of Jesus, we too point to him and draw others in to discover the life that he offers. So why are we so afraid to take the words of Jesus at face value?

His commands are not burdensome (1 John 5:3-4). They bring life (John 5:24). What's keeping us from hearing and believing the words of Scripture is not a corrupted text. It's our corrupted hearts. More than anything else, then, the most important tool we bring to the interpretation of Scripture is a heart transformed by the Holy Spirit.

<div class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>It should be noted that more liberal theologians engage in their share of proof-texting as well. I'm thinking, for instance, of the way Matthew 25:34-40 is constantly employed in the service of social justice causes (see <a href="http://www.politicaltheology.com/blog/the-politics-of-hospitality-matthew-2531-46/">Alastair Roberts’ helpful post</a> on why that passage is not as straightforward as it is often taken to be).</div>
