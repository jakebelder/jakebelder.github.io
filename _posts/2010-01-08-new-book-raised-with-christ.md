<p>While I was working yesterday a tweet popped up from <a href="http://www.adrianwarnock.com">Adrian Warnock</a> saying that he was starting a live chat session on his blog about his new book, <a href="http://raisedwithchrist.net/"><em>Raised With Christ: How the Resurrection Changes Everything</em></a>. I tuned in for a little while (though I was limited to text interaction since I had neither webcam or microphone with me), and enjoyed the discussion there. I was quite intrigued when I first heard about the book a short while ago. Here is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1433507161?tag=adrianwarno03-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1433507161">Amazon's product description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
What impact should Jesus' resurrection have on individuals and churches? Popular Christian blogger and teacher Adrian Warnock urges Christians not to neglect the implications of the resurrection.<br><br>

Jesus truly is alive today. But compared to his atoning death, Jesus' resurrection sparks relatively little discussion in the church. Inadvertently,we can become so focused on the good news that Christ died for our sins, that we almost forget he was "raised for our justification" (Romans 4:25).<br><br>

In <em>Raised with Christ</em>, author Adrian Warnock exhorts Christians not to neglect the resurrection in their teaching and experience. Warnock takes his cue from Acts, where every recorded sermon focuses on Jesus' resurrection. He stresses that Christians who faithfully proclaim both the death and the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and live out the implications of that message in vibrant, grace-filled churches, will be enabled to reach a world that lives in death's dark shadow.<br><br>

The power of the risen Christ is active in every true Christian,  transforming our lives. <em>Raised with Christ</em> will help you  discover afresh the massive implications of the empty tomb. Jesus'  resurrection really has changed everything.

<p>When I was in college, one of my professors, <a href="http://www.redeemer.ca/faculty/jim-payton.aspx">Jim Payton</a>, was always very intentional about stressing the resurrection for similar reasons. Part of his interest in Eastern Orthodoxy (about which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Light-Christian-East-Introduction-Tradition/dp/0830825940/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1262985847&amp;sr=1-1">he has written a great introductory book</a>) was owing to the fact that they place far more stress on the resurrection than Protestants do.</p>

I think Warnock's concern is a legitimate one, and I'm looking forward to getting a copy of the book. There are a myriad of theological implications in the resurrection, and it is good to recognize that the work of Christ, and the gospel itself, is incomplete without it.
