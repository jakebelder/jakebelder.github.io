Preaching aims, in part, to confront the sin in the lives of the hearers, in order that they might be convicted to turn from sin and turn to Christ. Often the idea of fighting sin is equated simply with behaviour modification, and while that is partly true – turning from sin should change our behaviour – it goes much deeper than that.

[Tim Keller](http://www.timothykeller.com/author/), in his book, *[The Reason for God](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/034097933X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=034097933X&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, says that “sin is the despairing refusal to find your deepest identity in your relationship and service to God. Sin is seeking to become oneself, to get an identity, apart from him” (162). Keller goes on to say that all sin leads to emptiness, because we look to build our identity on things in this world, and turn to them to try and fill a void inside of us. But because that void was only ever meant to be filled by God, these things never satisfy us.

Keller continues:

<blockquote>
As Augustine said, if there is a God who created you, then the deepest chambers of your soul simply cannot be filled up by anything less. That is how great the human soul is. If Jesus is the Creator-Lord, then by definition nothing could satisfy you like he can, even if you are successful. Even the most successful careers and families cannot give the significance, security, and affirmation that the author of glory and love can (172-173).
</blockquote>

I find Keller's understanding of sin here (and fleshed out much more in his later book, *[Counterfeit Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0340995084/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0340995084&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*) to be very helpful, and in my preaching, this understanding is often lurking in the background, giving shape to what I say. There is nothing more I want than for people to desire Jesus alone. But I actually find this difficult to communicate. By that I mean that I think it is easier to convince people that they should abandon a certain behaviour because of its negative effects than it is to convince them that underneath their sinful behaviour lies a longing that can only be satisfied by Jesus. As simple as that truth is, it often feels to me like it is really hard to drive that point home.

One of the things I have had to learn as a preacher is that there are limits to what I can say. And that, I think, is what I need to recognise in this case as well. Here is a simple truth, and as a preacher I am just called to point to Jesus as the one who satisfies all our deepest longings and desires, and to let the Holy Spirit go to work in the hearts of the hearers to convict them of that reality. I can only say so much, and need to believe that through the power of the Spirit, those who are listening will grasp the fullness of what is being offered as Jesus is held out to them.

I know my faith in the work of the Spirit still needs to grow, and I keep praying that I will get to the point where I stop expecting my words to do his work. If you are a preacher, do you struggle with this sort of thing too?
