<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>30 December 2012-05 January 2013</strong>.</p>

<li><a href="http://glenandpaula.com/wordpress/archives/2010/02/25/pre-christian-uses-of-gospel" target="_blank"><strong>Pre-Christian Uses of 'Gospel'</strong></a> - The author writes, 'In English, the word <em>gospel</em> is laden with religious meaning, but when Jesus and the apostles used the word <em>euangelion</em> (good news/gospel) they were using a nonreligious word from their culture.' This is quite an interesting post.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stmarysmaidenhead.org/churchbuilder/view-doc.php?zonename=touchline&amp;docid=20962&amp;buffer_share=59170&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>A Hundredfold</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/SamAllberry" target="_blank">Sam Allberry</a>, associate minister at <a href="http://www.stmarysmaidenhead.org" target="_blank">St Mary's, Maidenhead</a>, talks about struggling with homosexuality, but choosing faithfulness because Jesus is worth it. It is very encouraging that people in positions like this are willing to be so honest and to set a godly example by standing firm on the authority of Scripture and upholding the Lordship of Christ in their lives. </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20888141" target="_blank">Spiritual, but not religious</a></strong> - Here we go again with people trying to deny the fact that humans are fundamentally and inescapably religious beings. True, some may be more tuned into spiritual things, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/god-cannot-be-ignored" target="_blank">but everyone is religious</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://god52.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/guest-blog-anon-on-adoption/" target="_blank">Guest blog: 'Anon' on adoption</a></strong> - Someone anonymous wrote a blog post about going through the adoption process, and adopting a child simply because they want to. It is not a last resort, or even a second choice, but they simply want to adopt as an act of radical generosity. This is really encouraging.</li>
<li> <a href="http://michaeljkruger.com/the-forgotten-second-coming/" target="_blank"><strong>The Forgotten Second Coming</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/michaeljkruger" target="_blank">Michael J. Kruger</a>, in this helpful post, suggests that many Christians miss the eschatological focus of the Bible, and lists three things at stake if our faith is not future-oriented.</li>
