Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>09-15 March 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ivpCfG">The kind of unity we need</a></strong> – In response to series of articles that have recently been published thinking about the future of the Church of England, <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> offers this thoughtful piece. He calls for a 'bounded diversity', and says, 'spaces are only created by boundaries, and the myth of the Church of England as an infinitely extendable broad church needs to be killed off.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ivqReY">Praise Bands are the New Medieval Priests</a></strong> – Interesting (and provocative) post on how praise bands are driving us away from the nature and purpose of worship. The author writes that, like in the days of the medieval priests, 'we are going back to non-participatory, secret language, performative worship. Just like priests who lead worship in a language that few spoke, Praise Bands are incompatible with a worship that is done by the community. Rock Bands are by design meant to overwhelm the audience with sound. They are a performative medium, not a participatory one.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ngL5jc">The Freedom Baptism Brings</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> offers an intriguing reading of Galatians 3:28, and its relationship to the issue of marriage and celibacy.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/dangers-appealing-personality-types/">The Dangers of Appealing to Personality Types</a></strong> – Here's a good post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> on why we pay too much attention to personality tests and types, and ought to focus on the idea of 'character' instead. He applies this specifically to how we read Scripture, and makes some very helpful observations.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lWbpxf">Atonement and Re-creation</a></strong> – This is a fascinating post from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> analysing a certain reading of the day of atonement rituals. He notes that there is no reference in Leviticus 16 to forgiveness, but instead that the day seems to be all about re-pristination and re-creation. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1m06ZFG">The Thirty Nine Articles in Thirty Nine Tweets</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/MartinBDavie">Martin Davie</a> attempts to sum up each of the Thirty-Nine Articles in 140 characters or less. An interesting experiment.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1m2TKnO">Hope Beyond Frustration: Biblical Wisdom for the Cultural Apocalypse</a></strong> – This is a great piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a>. We might live in a world where as Christians we are often frustrated, but we still press on in hope, because 'in faith, we organize our lives around what God has promised, not what we can see.' He concludes with these encouraging words: 'Hope is anti-frustration because hope gives us confidence that the world will not forever remain as it now is. At present, the gospel and the way of life it implies sounds like a noisy gong and clanging cymbal. The eyes and ears of many are closed. But we serve a God who heals the blind and opens ears with a touch.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1m31cPF">Three Elements of Trinitarianism in the New Testament</a></strong> – When people ask <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> if the doctrine of the Trinity is in the Bible, he says, 'Yes'. He continues, 'Even though we don’t have the fully-formulated statement of the doctrine of the Trinity in Scripture, we do have the doctrine. To say less is not to say enough.' This is a helpful piece.</li>
