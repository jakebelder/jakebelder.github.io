Yesterday was Trinity Sunday, a day in which the church reflects upon the nature of the God we serve and worship. For some people, unfortunately, that will have meant being subject to a preacher attempting to explain the Trinity analogously, something which is impossible to do. This video, one of the best ever produced by [Lutheran Satire](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheLutheranSatire/videos), demonstrates that when you try to use an illustration to describe the Trinity, you are guaranteed to fall into heresy.<br><br>

Iâ€™m reminded of something my friend, [David Camera](http://twitter.com/DavidCamera1), pastor of the [church](http://www.riveroakschurch.com) we belonged to in Florida, once said about trying to understand the Trinity in a sermon:

<blockquote>
We don't understand the Trinity. But I would rather hold to the mystery than try to explain it away and fall into some sort of heresy. All heresy in the history of the Christian church is a result of trying to explain away the mystery. We have to embrace the mystery. Why would I think I could comprehend the nature of God? Why would I want to make God that small? I'm not going to sacrifice God on the altar of my finite, fallen human wisdom. That's what people do all day, as if God has to bend to our thinking. The mystery of this Triune God should spur us on to greater awe and worship of this incomprehensible, transcendent, unfathomable God.
</blockquote>

This is not to say that we should never reflect on the nature of God; indeed, as [Mike Reeves](http://twitter.com/mike_reeves) helpfully demonstrates in his book, *[The Good God: Enjoying Father, Son, and Spirit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1842277448/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1842277448&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, the fact that God is Triune has massive implications for the gospel and for our salvation. But we can understand the implications of who God is without fully understanding the nature of who God is. And that's not a bad thing, because a god you can fully understand is no god at all.

Embrace the mystery.
