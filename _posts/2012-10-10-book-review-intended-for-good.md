<p>One of the things I have thought about doing on this blog is incorporating some short book reviews as a more regular feature. I begin with <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/melvin.htm" target="_blank">Melvin Tinker's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844745708/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1844745708&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Intended for Good: The Providence of God</em></a> (Nottingham: Inter-Varsity Press, 2012).*</p>

<p>Noting first that he is writing on a doctrine that is not as commonly talked about as it once was, Tinker begins with the assertion that 'the doctrine of God's providence should be amongst the first refuges a Christian should seek in order to find strength and comfort' (13). Combining theological and biblical reflection with his experience as a pastor, he sets out in the rest of the book to justify that statement.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the book is a reflection on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%208:28&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 8:28</a>, which sets the stage for helping us to understand that God is sovereignly at work in all the circumstances of our lives. God is at work for our good in all things, although sometimes it may take hindsight for us to see that. But understanding and finding comfort in the doctrine of providence begins with that foundational truth.</p>
<p>The rest of the book is largely composed of reflections on various passages of Scripture, drawing out and exploring different facets of the doctrine of providence. We see how providence works in conjunction with human responsibility, how it works in our lives as individuals, the link between providence and prayer, providence and suffering, and the work of providence in bringing people to faith. Tinker takes the time to work through the narratives of biblical figures such as Joseph, Job, and Ruth to show how God was directing the course of their lives for their good and his glory. Any notion of providence equating with fatalism is done away with, and God is shown to be exactly who he is ‒ a loving God who is intimately concerned and involved with the lives of his people. In doing so, Tinker provides a great encouragement to us that this same God is concerned with each of our lives.</p>
<p>A helpful appendix at the end of the book briefly explores a couple of different and relatively common perspectives on providence, but Tinker ably demonstrates that they don't align with Scripture, concluding that the 'classic Reformed view', which comes out of the tradition of scholars like Augustine and Calvin, and which he adheres to, is the most faithful to the biblical teaching on providence.</p>
<p>In the end, the book is well worth reading, and passing on to anyone who may need encouragement that God is in control. It is warm and thoroughly pastoral, and leaves the reader with a great sense of comfort. God truly does work in all things for the good of those who love him.</p>
<p><strong>Rating: <span style="color: #ff9900;">★★★★★</span></strong></p>
