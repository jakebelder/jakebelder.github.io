On this Christmas Day, I give you these simple words of [St Irenaeus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus), in which he sums up the wonder of the incarnation of Christ:

<blockquote>
Because of His measureless love, He became what we are in order to enable us to become what He is.
</blockquote>

May your Christmas be filled with joy as you remember the birth of our Saviour. O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

Merry Christmas, everyone.
