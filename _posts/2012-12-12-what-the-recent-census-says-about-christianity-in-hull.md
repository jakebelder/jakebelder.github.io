<p>In those days, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Caesar Augustus</span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics" target="_blank">The Office for National Statistics </a>issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Roman world</span> United Kingdom.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20677515" target="_blank">the results of that census were released</a>. As you might expect, the results and statistics have already been widely discussed, and of particular interest to many has been what those statistics indicate about the continued role of religion in general and of Christianity in specific in this nation. One of the things that has been noted repeatedly is the general decline in the number of those who self-identified as Christians, and the increasing number of those who said they had no religion. This is hardly surprising, of course.</p>
<p>I received an email yesterday from our diocese with a link to <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_290510.pdf" target="_blank">a PDF containing a survey of the results</a> of what the census said about Christianity and religion. This line was specifically highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
The proportion of people identifying with Christianity has decreased in all local authorities in England and Wales since 2001 with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_Upon_Hull" target="_blank">Kingston Upon Hull</a> seeing the largest drop of 16.8 percentage points.
</blockquote>
<p>When we moved here, I was told that Hull was one of the cities in the UK with the lowest church attendance, and so the most recent information seems to fit. But I think it is important to note that this does not necessarily indicate a negative trend, because the reality is that many who self-identify as Christians are not Christians. I meet people all the time who say they are Christians, but all that means to them is that they have been baptised and have some vague belief in an undefined god. We then have to do the work of deconstructing their cultural notions of Christianity and bringing them to understand what biblical Christianity looks like, and to recognise that in order to be saved, they must confess with their mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in their heart that God raised him from the dead (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2010:9-13&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 10:9</a>). The decline in the number of self-identifying Christians, then, is simply an indication that people are being more honest about who they are. And this, to be sure, is a good thing.</p>

What does this mean for those of us at <a href="http://www.stjohnnewland.org.uk" target="_blank">St John's</a> and at other churches across the city? In one sense, it makes our work a bit easier, since there will be less instances where we first need to break down false ideas of Christianity when sharing the gospel with people. But in another sense, it doesn't really change anything. We will simply continue to press on in earnest with the work that God has called us to here. However you look at it, there is much work to be done.
