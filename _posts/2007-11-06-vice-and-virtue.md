<p>In his book, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steering-Through-Chaos-Virtue-Confusion/dp/1576831582/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2706602-6664420?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194410302&amp;sr=8-1">Steering Through Chaos: Vice and Virtue in an Age of Moral Confusion</a></span>, Os Guinness takes the seven deadly sins and contrasts them with the beatitudes, instead of the traditional virtues.  The schema looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
Pride ↔ Blessed are those who are poor in spirit<br>
Envy ↔ Blessed are those who mourn<br>
Anger ↔ Blessed are the meek<br>
Sloth ↔ Blessed are those who hunger for righteousness<br>
Avarice ↔ Blessed are those who are merciful<br>
Gluttony ↔ Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake<br>
Lust ↔ Blessed are the pure in heart<br>
</blockquote>

The traditional understanding is that the seven deadly sins correspond with the virtues of humility (modesty), kindness (admiration), forgiveness (composure), diligence (zeal/initiative), charity (giving), temperance (self-restraint), and chastity (purity of soul), respectively.  What do you think of matching the vices instead with the corresponding beatitudes, as Guinness has done?  Is this plausible, and does it dig in with more depth?
