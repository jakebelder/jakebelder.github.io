I read something last night that made me think. Brian McLaren, the most notable figure in the Emerging Church movement, stated that he was deeply influenced by the soteriology of Eastern Orthodoxy. While I found this interesting, and need to read more to find out what exactly McLaren means when he says he is influenced by this, it made me think about some other things. My first thought was that this would make a great thesis topic for a doctoral degree---comparing the soteriologies of Eastern Orthodoxy and the Emerging Church, to see if there is a link as McLaren postulates. But that was only a quick thought.

I began to wonder how the Orthodox in the Western world deal with the cultural milieu that surrounds us now. Do they perceive and acknowledge a postmodern shift, and if so, how do they deal with it? The Orthodox are a Church that believes they maintain the most true theological tradition, that they are the continuation of the apostolic tradition. They have used the same liturgy for worship for something like 1700 years. With this steadfast holding to tradition, what would the engaging of culture look like to them? What would it mean to be relevant? I've emailed a leader of the Orthodox Church in America who answers questions about Orthodoxy in regards to the questions I've just raised here. When I hear back, I'll post his reply. In the meantime, what are your thoughts?
