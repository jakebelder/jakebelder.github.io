Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 280px; height: 373px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/american_dream.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>04-10 August 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/19IAkPe">The False Promises of the Early Church</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/uribrito">Uri Brito</a> makes a helpful observation about our tendency to look at the Early Church as a sort of golden age that needs to be imitated today. He reminds us that the Early Church actually had a lot of problems because it was the church in its infancy, and that the church is called to grow and mature. There are things to learn from the Early Church, to be sure, but it is not the ideal.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15KonnO">Comparison of Philosophical Theories in the Late 20th Century</a></strong> – If you have trouble understanding the ins-and-outs of all the different philosophical theories, <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebishopuk">Steve Bishop</a> has posted something which you may find helpful. It is philosophy explained with toys.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eruhfA">Online Discourse, Leadership, Progressive Evangelicalism, and the Value of Critics</a></strong> – If you blog, tweet, use Facebook, or engage in online conversation in some other way, this post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> is well worth reading. Taking note of some of the problems that have developed in recent years, he makes some helpful observations about the nature of online discourse, and what we can do to make it more healthy.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cMDO2C">The Pessimist: "How to Be Outraged on the Internet"</a></strong> – Following Alastair's post, it was then quite amusing to come across this, which is a guide to doing exactly what Alastair says we shouldn't. Please take it as humour, and don't put these into practise!</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cLXwLZ">Pray Right On the Spot</a></strong> – Here is another good post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager's</a> blog. This time he writes about those times when we <em>say</em> we will pray for someone, and encourages us to pray right then and there instead of just saying we'll pray. This is a wise and fruitful practice.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14nSySc">“But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth?"</a></strong> – A great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/davebish">Dave Bish</a> on the implications of God coming to dwell with us and what that means for how we are to live in this world.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14qWxx6">Families, Flourishing, and Upward Mobility</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> is often critical of the so-called 'American Dream', but at the same time he notes that some aspects of the Dream are important and necessary for the flourishing of society as a whole. He goes on to note that there are two things in particular which encourage this flourishing, namely, the stability of family structures and the presence of religious communities.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1exovcc">You, Me, and the Heavenly Three?</a></strong> – While I certainly think the Trinity tells us something about our relationships with each other, I've always been uncomfortable with the way people use the Trinity to talk about gender, largely for the reasons <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> addresses here. This is a helpful post. For a much fuller discussion of the topic, <a href="http://youtu.be/v0_mYvbgcKE">watch this discussion between Fred and Kevin Giles</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cyYDQD">A Conflict of Christian Visions: Gen 1-2 vs. Gen 3 Christianity</a></strong> – Here is an excellent post from <a href="http://twitter.com/drantbradley">Anthony Bradley</a> on why it is crucial that our understanding of Christianity begins with Genesis 1-2 instead of Genesis 3. Far too often people make sin the starting point, which narrows our understanding of the gospel and of salvation. Redemption is much bigger, and faithful living begins with a holistic gospel that is rooted in a robust doctrine of creation. This is really, really important stuff, and <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/all-of-life">one of the reasons I address the issue often on this blog</a>.</li>
