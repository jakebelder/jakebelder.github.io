This initiative, supported by [Trinity Grace Church](http://trinitygracechurch.com/) in New York City, is exactly the type of thing churches need to get behind. Encourage, equip, and empower your people to seek the flourishing and renewal of your cities, because this is how they will be changed.<br><br>
