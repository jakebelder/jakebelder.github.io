Here is a conversation that went on over on my Facebook wall a few days ago:<br><br>

<p>You can see from one of my responses that I had ulterior motives for posting the question, more than just finding out what people thought about it (as interesting as that was). The reason I initially posed the question was because I was reading <a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Women_Service_Church.htm">an article by N.T. Wright the other day regarding his position on the ordination of women</a>, and the point discussed above came up. The context was a discussion of Paul's instructions for worship in 1 Corinthians 11. Wright's conclusions are as follows (and you may need to read more of his article for the broader argument):</p>
<blockquote>
The underlying point then seems to be that in worship it is important for both men and women to be their truly created selves, to honour God by being what they are and not blurring the lines by pretending to be something else. One of the unspoken clues to this passage may be Paul&rsquo;s assumption that...in worship we are anticipating [creation's] eventual restoration (15.27&ndash;28).<br><br>

...When humans are renewed in the Messiah and raised from the dead, they will be set in authority over the angels (6.3). In worship, the church anticipates how things are going to be in that new day. When a woman is praying or prophesying (perhaps in the language of angels, as in 13.1), she needs to be truly what she is, since it is to male and female alike, in their mutual interdependence as God&rsquo;s image-bearing creatures, that the world, including the angels, is to be subject. God&rsquo;s creation needs humans to be fully, gloriously and truly human, which means fully and truly male and female. This, and of course much else besides, is to be glimpsed in worship.<br><br>

The Corinthians, then, may have drawn the wrong conclusion from the &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; that Paul had taught them. Whether or not they could follow his argument any better than we can, it seems clear that his main aim was that the marks of difference between the sexes should not be set aside in worship. At least perhaps.<br><br>

We face different issues, but making sure that our worship is ordered appropriately, to honour God&rsquo;s creation and anticipate its fulfilment in the new creation, is still a priority. There is no &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo; about that. When we apply this to the question of women&rsquo;s ministry, it seems to me that we should certainly stress equality in the role of women but should be very careful about implying identity. This passage tells, for me at least, quite strongly on the side of those who see the ministry of women as significantly different to the ministry of men and therefore insists that we need both to be themselves, rather than for one to try to become a clone of the other.
</blockquote>
<p>The point of this post is not to state or defend a position on women's ministry and ordination, but I will confess that I found Wright's line of reasoning confusing. I have not heard this argument before in the material I have read on the subject (including the <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/4197/nm/Two+Views+on+Women+in+Ministry+%28Counterpoints%29+%28Paperback%29?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Counterpoints book on women in ministry</a>, and numerous papers and articles). I realise that this is only one point in his broader argument, but I am really not sure how Wright got from arguing that worship is an anticipation of the new creation to arguing, essentially, that women should be ordained. What especially strikes me is that he keeps emphasising equality of the sexes while emphasising different identities and marks of women and men (a point which the 'complementarian' camp makes frequently in defense of their practice of not ordaining women).</p>

If those of you who participated in the initial discussion have come over here to read this, what do you think now? How would you change or add to your previous answer to the question? What do you think of Wright's reasoning? For everyone else, what do you think?
