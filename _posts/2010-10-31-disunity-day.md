<p>As children innocently prepare their costumes and empty bags or pillowcases for an enjoyable  evening of collecting candy, evangelicals will be battling the forces of Satan on two fronts tonight: boycotting Halloween, and gathering together for a few rousing rounds of Rome-bashing.</p>
<p>Now, I don't enjoy Halloween (specifically what American culture has made of it), and have no problem with those who wish to abstain from participating in it; there are many good reasons not to. However, I am sure there are many doing so tonight who have no idea what they are actually boycotting. They prefer to ignore all that history and instead seize on to the opportunity to celebrate another day which nicely coincides with this awful pagan holiday&mdash;Reformation Day.</p>
<p>Lest I sound too cynical, let me note that I am, indeed, very thankful the Reformation happened&mdash;I am glad that the doctrines of grace were recovered, I am glad that the abuse of power by corrupt church leaders was curtailed, and I am glad that I did not have to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">pay for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica">St. Peter&rsquo;s</a> to be built</span> pay for my relatives to be sprung from purgatory. The Reformation is most certainly something to be thankful for. But one question continues to linger in my mind&mdash;would we even celebrate Reformation Day if it didn't conveniently fall on the same night as Halloween?</p>
<p>We might ask why we need a special night to celebrate the Reformation. On the one hand, it seems to be the equivalent of using Valentine's Day to tell your wife that you love her. As your love for her should be manifest each day, shouldn't our rejoicing in God's saving grace be something we do each day? This grace should pour forth from the preaching of the Word and we should taste it in partaking of the Lord's Table each Sunday. Do we really need a specific day to commemorate this?</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">Martin Luther's</a>&nbsp;act of nailing the 95 Theses to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints'_Church,_Wittenberg">church door in Wittenberg</a> was not the monumental act of defiance that many make it out to be. He only intended to raise a discussion about various issues concerning the Catholic Church with his academic peers. Luther's innocent action exploded into the major events that followed only because some random guy grabbed the piece of paper off the door, translated it into German, and sent copies of it all throughout the country. Do we need to a special day to remember that autumn day in 1517 when Luther walked up the stairs to the door of the Wittenberg church and made known his desire to have an academic discussion with his colleagues?</p>
<p>Hardly. So what is it, then, that evangelicals end up celebrating on Reformation Day? To be sure, there are those who will understand and acknowledge the theological implications of the Reformation. But for others, Reformation Day is, for all intents and purposes, a day to celebrate the disunity of the church. That, to me, is certainly <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> worth celebrating.<br /><br />For some reason, people seem to forget that while Luther&nbsp;ultimately made the move to break from the Roman Catholic Church, he did not do so immediately. He spent years in agony deciding whether or not to leave the church he knew as mother and to go against Christ's call for unity in the body of believers (John 17:20-26, 1 Corinthians 1:10). People also forget that Luther was not the first Reformer, and that there were many who went before him who also tried earnestly to reform the church from within. Separating from the church was never the intention of these men, yet their valiant efforts to remain united seem to go unheralded. Instead, we prefer to celebrate the Protestant break from Rome, the second-most definitive and drastic split in the history of the church (the first being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism">Great Schism of 1054</a>).<br /><br />Am I advocating a return to Rome? No. Do I think the church will ever be one this side of our Lord's return? Of course not. Am I thankful for the work of the Reformers? Absolutely&mdash;I count it a great privilege to be rooted in the theological heritage they left us. But we can't forget that the Reformation also produced a lot of collateral damage. When you have to start constructing graphs that look like the one below (and this is just the <span style="font-style: italic;">American Presbyterians</span>!) something is terribly wrong. And it is nothing to celebrate.</p>
