<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Sasse">Hermann Sasse</a>, a twentieth-century Lutheran theologian, had this to say regarding humanity's efforts to create an ideal church:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Ubi Christus, ibi ecclesia</em>, 'Where Christ is, there is the   church'. With this saying one of the oldest church fathers spoke of the   mystery of the church. The saying also sums up Luther&rsquo;s faith in the   church. It is not the power of our faith, nor the holiness of our life   that constitutes the church, but rather that 'Where Christ is, there is   the church'.  When the church is called a holy people, a communion of   saints, it is not to be understood in the way it has often been   understood in the history of the church: 'the church should be a holy   people, therefore only the holy shall belong to her. Away with all the   unholy! The honour of Christ demands it!' When the worst of sinners must   be excluded from the fellowship,  one must then begin to classify sins   in order to determine which ones lead to exclusion. How often has not   that been attempted, both in the past and more recently. How imposing   was the strictness of the ancient church, when people sought to create a   holy and pure church (as also happens now). Or consider the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatists" target="_blank">Donatists</a>,   who demanded that at least the clergy should be free of mortal sin.   Whenever the attempt has been made to create an ideal church, the end   result has always been bitter disappointment. The community of saints   turns into a community of Pharisees.
</blockquote>
<p>As the Dutch theologian, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a>, notes in the fourth volume of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Dogmatics-Spirit-Church-Creation/dp/0801026571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1280333120&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Reformed Dogmatics</em></a>, 'according to Scripture the characteristic essence of the church lies in the fact that it is the people of God' (298), of which Christ is the head. The church exists because Christ 'gathers, protects, and preserves for himself a community chosen for eternal life and united in true faith' (Heidelberg Catechism, <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_spirit.cfm#QandA%2054">Q&amp;A 54</a>).</p>

The church is not primarily an institution, nor is it a group of people who live perfectly holy lives or believe all the right things. To be sure, the church does have an institutional character, and its members do strive to be increasingly holy and to be faithful to Scripture in their doctrine. But none of these precede the fact that the church people of God, over which Christ is Lord.
