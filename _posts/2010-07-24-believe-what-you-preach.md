<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott">John Stott</a>, in discussing the necessity of pastors to be sincere in what they preach, cites a story in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Worlds-Challenge-Preaching/dp/0802806279/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279668685&amp;sr=8-4"><em>Between Two Worlds</em></a>, about the 18th century philosopher, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">David Hume</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">A friend once met [Hume] hurrying along a London street and asked him where he was going. Hume replied that he was going to hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield">George Whitefield</a> preach. 'But surely,' his friend asked in astonishment, 'you don't believe what Whitefield preaches, do you?' 'No, I don't,' answered Hume, 'but he does.' (269-270)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whitefield had a transparent sincerity that attracted Hume. So it must be with us. John Poulton has said, "The most effective preaching comes from those who embody the things they are saying. They <em>are</em> the message."</p>

That couldn't be more true.
