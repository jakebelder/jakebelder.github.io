Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 250px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/time.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>06-11 January 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aeACgi">Where Does the World Need Me?</a></strong> – <em><a href="http://twitter.com/commentmag">Comment Magazine</a></em> online has an article here with eight short profiles of Christians who are seeking the good and the flourishing of the places they live. There are some really encouraging things here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aeAZr3">On going to heaven</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PastorSteveJeff">Steve Jeffrey</a> comments on the ESV's translation of 2 Timothy 4:18, suggesting it is unhelpful and leads the reader towards the unbiblical idea that 'heaven' is our ultimate goal.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/K4XdkY">9 Reasons I Am Thankful To Be A Calvinist</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> started using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23keyCalvinistmoments">#keyCalvinistmoments</a> on Twttier earlier this week as a fun way to talk about his deepening understanding of the Reformed tradition. <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> joined in and then decided to sum up his thinking in this excellent post, which very much gets at the heart of what it really means to be Reformed.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1bR9d07">R. Scott Clark the Theologian</a></strong> – Clark is a professor at Westminster Theological Seminary in California who recently wrote a critique of <a href="http://www.rts.edu/seminary/faculty/bio.aspx?id=502">John Frame's</a> newly-published systematic theology, and while this post references that critique in particular, it makes a great point about the way we do theology. Clark's method is to consider his tradition the sole guardian of orthodoxy, and anything which does not fit within his rigid boundaries is to be tossed out. There is simply no room for inquiry.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dUSPAt">The Search for Authority & the Fear of Difference</a></strong> – This is a very interesting post which basically poses the question, do we take our responsibility to think seriously?</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dV4LCm">Traditions that are Not in the Bible</a></strong> – There are many different traditions and practices in the church that are not specifically commanded in the Bible, but have been part of the church's life for centuries. This post answers the question of what we are supposed to do with these, and helpfully looks at the role of tradition in shaping our faith and practice.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/KI2SyD">Liturgical revision: 'sin' versus 'evil'</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a> comments on the recent proposal to change the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org">Church of England's</a> baptism liturgy, and offers some helpful comments on why general talk of 'evil' is not enough, and why we need to continue talking about sin.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1d28iOV">Invisible Anglicanism of CS Lewis</a></strong> – There was a lot of hype about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> last year, but the author of this post says that one thing you didn't hear much about was Lewis as a committed Anglican, which is actually significant in understanding both who he is, and his thinking. The author uses this point to helpfully demonstrate that belonging to a confessional tradition matters.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1d27sls">The Gift of Time</a></strong> – Here is a great post that appeared on <a href="http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation">The Washington Institute's</a> blog this week on how Christians think about time. The author writes, "Half of Christianity is about learning what it means to hope well—to hope amongst the slow speed of time’s sanctification. The church calendar reminds us redemption will not be rushed. The story cannot be told faster. Time is a gift, a gift in need of redemption, but still a place to encounter the transformative presence of the God who is life incarnate."</li>
