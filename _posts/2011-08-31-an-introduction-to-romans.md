This video was posted by [St John's Nottingham](http://www.stjohns-nottm.ac.uk/) a few weeks ago, and I found it quite helpful to hear [N.T. Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright) give his introduction to the book of Romans. Particularly helpful is his explanation of what he thinks Paul means by 'the righteousness of God'. This has been one of the major points of contention in Wright's theology, and his critics have often challenged him about his understanding of the phrase. Regardless, the 22-minute clip is worth your time.
