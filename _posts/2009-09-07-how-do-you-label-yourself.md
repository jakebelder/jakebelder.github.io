<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Duncan">John "Rabbi" Duncan</a> was a 19th-century Scottish pastor and theologian well-known for his aphorisms, many of which remain popular today.  A few days ago, Guy Davies, a pastor in the south of England, <a href="http://exiledpreacher.blogspot.com/2009/09/rabbi-duncan-was-catholic-and-so-am-i.html">posted this one on his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm first a Christian, next a catholic, then a Calvinist, fourth a paedobaptist, and fifth a Presbyterian. I cannot reverse this order.</blockquote>

While Guy would substitute "Baptist" and "Independent" in the last two slots, his intention in posting the quote was to reflect the importance of recognizing ourselves as belonging to the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.  Duncan considers the catholicity of the Church second only in importance to being a Christian, assigning that identification a much more prominent place than many evangelicals today do.

What interested me most about this was the ordering in which Duncan labeled himself.  It is always tricky to affix labels to yourself, and I do not usually go beyond calling myself a Christian first, and then Reformed (although I do label myself more specifically as a Niceno-Constantinopolitan <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Calvinism">Neocalvinist</a> on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jakebelder">Facebook profile</a>).  What Duncan is implying is that there is right way to order the labels you use to identify yourself.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 497px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/coneofcertainty.jpg" /></div>
In some ways, this reflects something <a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=449">Richard Pratt</a> used to teach here at <a href="http://www.rts.edu/site/about/campuses/orlando/index.aspx">Reformed Theological Seminary</a>.  To help people think through the ordering of their beliefs he used a three-dimensional model of a cone, which he called the Cone of Certainty. If you looked at the cone from the top, the narrow point in the center would be where the central tenants of Christianity are located, those beliefs which are non-negotiable and clearly revealed in Scripture.  The second layer contains what Pratt calls middle beliefs, those which we find to be important and which often serve as the distinguishing marks between our different denominations or camps.  The peripheral beliefs represent those which, for the most part, do not affect our orthodoxy and which believers in the same camps can hold differing views on.

Looking at the side profile of the cone teaches us something else.  The top is a very narrow point indicating that there is essentially no room for negotiation.  Failure to confess these beliefs results in heterodoxy. These beliefs require a great deal of harmony. The middle part of the cone is wider indicating that there is some room for different interpretation such that orthodoxy is not necessarily compromised, although believers may wish to affiliate themselves on this level with like-minded groups.  Finally, the widest part of the cone is at the base and at the beliefs we hold at this level do not require complete harmony.  These may be the so-called "gray" areas.

Obviously, given the shape of the cone, it cannot stand on its point.  It will fall over.  When we take peripheral beliefs and elevate them to the status of central, non-negotiable beliefs, we create instability.  Additionally, this serves to foster disunity in the Church.  And of course, those who diminish central beliefs and make them peripheral cease to be the Church altogether.

I think Duncan gets this.  He recognizes that our bonds as brothers and sisters in the Lord come from sharing those beliefs at the top of the cone (if he were to use the diagram).  If we make the bond of Christian fellowship contingent upon the affirmation of beliefs that occupy a place much farther down the list, we fail to uphold the unity to which Jesus called us.  Duncan recognized that the catholicity of the Church, while requiring belief in such essentials as stated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_versions_of_the_Nicene_Creed_in_current_use#Book_of_Common_Prayer_version_.281662.29">Nicene Creed</a>, was above more specific theological distinctions like Calvinism.  Further, while he found it important to identify himself as a paedobaptist, he recognized that there were Calvinists who were not but were nonetheless brothers and sisters in Christ.  Similarly, there were Calvinist paedobaptists who were not Presbyterians with whom he could unite in fellowship.

So there is a progression of widening distinction in Duncan's labeling that reflects Pratt's cone diagram.  Each label, while important to Duncan, is of less importance as it pertains to the unity of the Church.   His first two labels could be equated with the top of Pratt's cone, the next two (or maybe three) the middle beliefs.  He emphasizes this point by stating that his order cannot be reversed.

As it is right now, I would label myself very similar to Duncan.  The only thing I would change is substituting "Reformed" for Calvinist, since I know <a href="http://jakebelder.com/herman-selderhuis-the-discovery-of-john-calvi">Calvin didn't want his followers being known as Calvinists</a>.  And while I'm a Presbyterian at this point, if I found myself in a place where there were no Presbyterian churches I could be comfortable in churches which use different structures so long as they are still theologically Reformed.

How would you label yourself?
