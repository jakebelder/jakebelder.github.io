Last week, I spent a couple of days in the Netherlands for a conference on [the spirituality of the Heidelberg Catechism](http://www.tua.nl/index.php?paginaID=73&archief=agendastuk) at the [Theologische Universiteit Apeldoorn](http://www.tua.nl/), which put me in the same room as quite a few people from various Dutch Reformed churches. It was interesting to be in that context because I grew up in Dutch Reformed churches in Canada, planted by Dutch immigrants who had originally belonged to some of these denominations before they crossed the Atlantic.

Not knowing much about the history of the various Dutch Reformed denominations, it was quite interesting, then, to stumble across the graphic below the other day, which roughly sketches the timeline of Dutch church history, with a focus on the (many!) splits in the Reformed churches in the Netherlands. I find it amusing that the [Gereformeerde Kerken vrijgemaakt](http://www.gkv.nl/) (a close relative of the [Canadian and American Reformed Churches](http://www.canrc.org/)) claims the unbroken line of succession from the Apostles â€“ it makes it clear where the sympathies of the chart's drafter lie.
