<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>03-09 February 2013</strong>.</p>

<li><a href="http://bigbible.org.uk/2013/02/exodus-a-story-of-new-birth-zugzwanged/" target="_blank"><strong>Exodus: A Story of New Birth?</strong></a> - Here is a great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts</a> looking at the theme of new birth in Exodus. This is why biblical theology is so interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21319945" target="_blank"><strong>What happens at an atheist church?</strong></a> - I've posted some things on this new atheist 'church' in London before, and here's another in-depth report from the BBC about what goes on there. This article also includes a short video of part of the 'service'.</li>
<li><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5977205/why-the-moon-landings-could-have-never-ever-been-faked-the-definitive-proof" target="_blank"><strong>Why the Moon Landings Could Have Never EVER Been Faked: The Definitive Proof</strong></a> - I recently saw some discussion online again about how the 1969 moon landing was a big hoax, and I have to say, I simply cannot believe that there are people out there who still think like this. It just so happened that shortly afterwards I came across this video, which makes it perfectly clear that it was impossible to fake. If you know any doubters, pass this on to them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.9marks.org/blog/8-ways-pray-during-sermon-preparation" target="_blank">8 Ways to Pray During Sermon Preparation</a></strong> - Every preacher is well aware that prayer is an integral part of sermon preparation, and this short list of ways to pray during your preparation is very helpful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2013/02/i-confess-part-i.php" target="_blank"><strong>I Confess (Part I)</strong></a> - This is a good post from <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html" target="_blank">Carl Trueman</a> on how a church leader must relate to their church's confession. A confession sets up necessary boundaries within which a church leader must operate for the good of the church and those under their care.</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2013/02/faithful-presence-antithesis/" target="_blank"><strong>Faithful presence and its antithesis</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland" target="_blank">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> has been reading James Davison Hunter's excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0199730806/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0199730806&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>To Change the World</em></a>. Here Tim discusses how Christians must practice the idea of faithful presence and seek the flourishing of others.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2013/02/06/you-asked-should-i-get-re-baptized-paedobaptist-answer/" target="_blank"><strong>You Asked: Should I Get &lsquo;Re-Baptized&rsquo;?</strong></a> - Sometimes people who were baptised as infants were baptised as a matter of tradition by parents who weren't believers, and then later in life when they become Christians, often face the question of whether or not they should be baptised again. <a href="http://twitter.com/JaredOliphint" target="_blank">Jared Oliphint</a> answers this question in a helpful post, pointing to the efficacy of God's covenant faithfulness as the determining factor.</li>
