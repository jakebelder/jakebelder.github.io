If you study and read and think about the things I do long enough, you begin to see how all these different things begin to fit together--or at least how they should. You will have heard me use the word "worldview" here before, and what that basically denotes is the foundational beliefs and principles that govern your life (*Weltanschauung*, by the way, is the German word from where we get the word "worldview"). Of course, in the realm of semantics there are a number of varying definitions of the word, but I think that will suffice as a basic understanding of the word. Everybody has a worldview, whether they are conscious of it or not.

We live in an age of declared relativism, where people confess the right to believe whatever they want. You hear of those who put together their own religion composed of differing parts from all different religions that they find attractive. Truth becomes a hazy standard that is entirely up to the individual to determine, and no one truth need apply for anyone else but that individual, let alone a community or society.

Those of us who are Christians all share the very same basic root of our worldview--the person and work of Jesus Christ--but from there we are confronted with a great deal of diversity in our interpretations of what it means to live with that as our foundation. This post is not meant to try and convince you that one or another Christian worldview is the one you should follow; that is a more indirect purpose of my other posts. What I want to encourage you to do instead is to work to ensure that your worldview is comprehensive and coherent.

I have a number of regular people who comment on this blog who remind me, through the things that they say, of the need to determine the validity of my worldview on a regular basis. Some of today's leaders in the Church decry things like systematic theology as outdated and irrelevant for Christians in the 21st century. However, I am of the firm conviction that systematic thought of any sort is certainly not without its place. The fact is that if you assume a set of beliefs and principles that guide your life, and you do not apply those consistently to each area of your life and thought, glaring contradictions will emerge in short order. Look at the way we criticize politicians when they say one thing and do another. So it is when people look at us as Christians and see that contradiction as well. If you believe something, you need to live like you believe it.

Certainly, it is challenge to work towards a comprehensive worldview. But as a Christian, it is essential. If you are going to claim Jesus Christ as your Lord, he needs to be Lord of your entire life. You might interpret this in a different way than I do, but you cannot relegate his rule to only one part of your life. It has to impact all of it. I am constantly confronted with the fact that I do not live like this, but instead live sinfully before the face of God, giving my allegiance to other things in my life and in this world. I am grateful for those who help me see the idols I inadvertently worship and the misconstrued beliefs that I hold to. Though I often live like it, I am not the sole arbiter of truth, and need the community of believers to guide me in the wisdom of God.

Surround yourself with a community of believers who strives earnestly to discover what it means to live as Christians in this world and how to do that faithfully. If your current worldview has contradictions in it, work to resolve those. There is no divorce in the Christian faith, no part that is left untouched by the transforming power of the gospel. How you live and what you believe is not an indifferent matter. A comprehensive worldview enables you to live more and more as faithful servants of God in this world. Easy? No. Essential? Yes. Rewarding? Beyond measure.
