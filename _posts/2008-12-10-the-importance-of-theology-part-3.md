<p>This post will wrap up my short series on the importance of theology. I looked <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-importance-of-theology-i">first</a> at the role theology plays in forming our thinking, speaking, and acting; and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-importance-of-theology-ii">secondly</a>, at how we need not shy away from theology if we understand it properly.</p>
<p>To tie up some loose ends, let me begin by drawing your attention to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Church">Early Church</a>. What is interesting to me is how many in the Church today want to reclaim the model of the Early Church, citing it as more biblical and "back to basics." While again I can understand and appreciate the sentiment, I wonder how many realize how intense of a period this was in terms of theological development. You only need to read a little about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology#Historical_controversies">Christological controversies</a>, for example, to see how involved they were in theology and how pivotal their role was in shaping our theology today. It is also helpful to look to that volatile period as an example of why theology is so necessary.</p>
<p>Go back before that, even, and look at Jesus. I recently came across <a href="http://www.theologian.org.uk/doctrine/systematics.html">an interesting article</a> by <a href="http://www.theologian.org.uk/doctrine/systematics.html#authoranc">Mike Gilbart-Smith</a> in which he argued that Jesus was a sort of systematic theologian as well. He did not just quote Scripture in his teachings, but brought the passages He used to light in the broader context of the rest of the biblical revelation. Consider what Gilbart-Smith says:</p>

<blockquote>
Scripture is often used in Scripture in a systematic manner...in order to observe the full implications of what the Bible teaches elsewhere.<br /><br />

Look again at Mark 12:24-27. Jesus rebukes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> for not knowing the Scriptures, yet what he criticizes is a part of their systematic theology: they wrongly deny the resurrection. He then reads Exodus 3:6 in the light of the systematic belief that God is the God of the living, to reach the conclusion that the Pentateuch affirms the resurrection.<br /><br />

The statement, &lsquo;He is not the God of the dead but the God of the living,&rsquo; is particularly pertinent to our discussion. Not a single verse in the Old Testament makes this assertion explicitly, yet when we read of God&rsquo;s action in the Old Testament as a whole, that he is the God of the living is clear. Jesus is not giving new revelation when he says this. He is deducing it from a systematic reading of the Old Testament. Neither is Jesus alone a legitimate systematician, for if he were, he would not rebuke the Sadducees for wrong systematics. They too were expected to make such logical connections from Scripture. If Jesus expected it of the Sadducees, then how much more will he expect it of his redeemed people?</blockquote>

<p>Frequently, people who advocate the abandonment of theology will say something like, "just the Gospel!" or, "just give me Jesus!" It is clear from the quote above, however, that Jesus' message and teaching was not limited to the Gospel alone. Theology, as we have said, is the application of God's Word by persons to all areas of life. Jesus clearly demonstrates here the necessity of understanding the biblical revelation, in part because it leads to rightly understand the message of the Gospel. In the case of the Sadducees, they lacked the orthodoxy that was essential to orthopraxy. It should be noted as well that the Gospel, that simple message itself, is interwoven with the most basic yet profound theological formulations.</p>
<p>Contrary to what seems to be popular belief, it is not arrogant to take a theological position. It is necessary. How are you going to live faithfully if you don't have a set of convictions that you live according to? This is one of the reasons we engage in the the task of theology, to ensure that those convictions are consistent and biblical. Theology should not be a dry, intellectual, and scientific pursuit. It is instead a process and a journey and one that is most rewarding when faithfully carried out in the community of believers. Together as the body of Christ we work towards understanding so that we may all mold ourselves into His likeness. For as we continually work to faithfully be the <span style="font-style: italic;">imago Dei</span> we then can be more faithful in our engagement in the <span style="font-style: italic;">missio Dei</span>.</p>
Embrace theology. To know rightly is to worship and to live rightly. It is the knowledge and love of God's revelation to us in His most precious Word that transforms our hearts and minds. That Word reveals Jesus Christ to us in every part. Doing theology, then, is nothing less than learning how to become more like Him. There is no more wonderful pursuit than that.
