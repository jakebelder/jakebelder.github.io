Had my first class this morning at Reformed Theological Seminary here in Orlando. It was called Introduction to Pastoral and Theological Studies, and I think it's going to be great. It's basically an overview of the perspective and approach to teaching that the school takes. There's a lot of great stuff to learn and take hold of here. This is the course description:

</blockquote>
Learning RTS/Orlando’s window on the rest of the Christian (esp. evangelical) world. Learning a theological model whereby one may come to measured conclusions about theological truth claims. Learning to assess one’s own theology (where one is on the theological map). Learning personally to integrate theological & biblical knowledge, pastoral skills, and religious affections. Learning to read pastoral and theological literature well (with discernment and with charity). Learning to write theology clearly, concisely, and cogently. Learning to disagree well. Stepping into potentially lifelong ministry relationships.
</blockquote>

In addition to this, I'm taking History of Christianity I, History of Philosophy and Christian Thought, Systematic Theology I, and Theology of the Westminster Standards. I'm pumped, I think this is going to be a great year.

Of course, I need to thank God for this incredible provision and opportunity He has given me. I worried so much about how this was all going to work out, and really failed to trust Him that everything would unfold according to His plan. But it did, and He has opened a door for me that is going to provide unknown amounts of opportunity for me. What a great God we serve. To Him be all the glory!

Hey readers, leave me a comment and tell me what you are all up to right now---going to school, working, on sabbatical---tell me what takes up your time.
