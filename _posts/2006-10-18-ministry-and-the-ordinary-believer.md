Yesterday I read about a man by the name of Paavo Ruotsalainen. He was born in the parish of Iisalmi, Finland, in 1777. Outside of Finland, Ruotsalainen's importance is relatively little. However, in Finland he was one of the leaders of the most powerful pietist revivalist movements of the 19th century within the Lutheran Church. From an early age he was a strong pietist, having read his Bible through three times by the time he was confirmed. He became a well-known lay preacher and travelled vast distances to connect with other like-minded figures. He faced oppression and opposition by those who did not agree with him or were worried about what he was trying to do. The movement continued to gain strength and numbers, and after he died in 1852, it continued to shape the future of the Lutheran Church in Finland. Read more about him [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paavo_Ruotsalainen) and [here](http://countrystudies.us/finland/49.htm).

I was not particularly interested in what Ruotsalainen stood for, because I found it a little radical; furthermore, I am a Calvinist, not a Lutheran. But I was interested in the method in which it was achieved. He led a major revival movement within a large state church, but he did so as a layman. He was not a clergyman, bishop, or other high-ranking church officer, he was merely a peasant farmer who kept a pew seat warm in the church.

Growing up, I was generally part of more conservative churches where the locus of ministry was centered in the pastor and the elders of the church. Not much was expected of the rest of the congregation, the "ordinary" believers. I now belong to a church that fully embraces the idea of the priesthood of all believers, and seeks to actively engage all of them in ministry. I believe that this is a very important thing to do, especially when considering some of the things Paul wrote regarding the diversity of the body of believers and how each works together in a community in order to give glory to God by the mutual building up of each other and the empowering of fellow believers for ministry (see 1 Corinthians 12). This is one of the most straightforward indicators of the importance of lay ministry in the church, and a clear rejection of the notion of an ordinary believer.

Lay ministry also plays an important role in the leadership of the church much in the same way that Ruotsalainen functioned in the Finnish Lutheran Church. There are times when those who are officially ordained in ministry may lose sight of the vision of the church, or perhaps stumble over a theological point, or simply make wrong decisions about things. It is here that laymen are responsible for ensuring that these obstacles are overcome and Biblical truth is adhered to.

Of course, none of these functions can be performed without the proper instruction and education for members of the congregation. For these reasons the church throughout history has developed means of educating the people, be it through catechism classes, discipleship courses, or the more modern small group ministry. Whatever the tool may be, it is very important to the life and well-being of the congregation and its ability to fulfill its task and role as a universal priesthood.

Does this blur the line between ordained ministry figures and laymen? Not at all. Those who are ordained have gone through a specific training first directed at molding them into spiritual leaders and mentors who are the shepherds of the flocks of believers. Their responsibility through preaching and teaching the Word and pastoral ministry is to equip the laity to go forth from inside the church's walls and be the light of Christ to the world they are surrounded by. Lay ministry does not mean that each believer will become the pastor of a church, but it is focused on learning to be witnesses of Jesus and the coming Kingdom in every area of life. There simply is no ordinary believer. Those who think there is might do well to take a bit of a cue from the man from Iisalmi.
