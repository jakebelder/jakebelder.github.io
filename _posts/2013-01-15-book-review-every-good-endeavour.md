<p>Every year, people ask me what is on my Christmas list, and every year I reply that it contains just one (predictable) thing: books. This Christmas I was pleased to receive a copy of <a href="http://timothykeller.com/author/" target="_blank">Tim Keller's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1444702599/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1444702599&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Every Good Endeavour: Connecting Your Work to God's Plan for the World</em></a> (London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd, 2012).</p>

<p>I was eager to read this book because I have become increasingly aware of the need for the church's work of discipleship to include sustained focus on helping people understand how to do their work as Christians. Most of the people who fill our pews on Sunday are engaged in work from Monday to Friday, but as <a href="http://www.faithandwork.org/staff_page205.php" target="_blank">Katherine Leary Alsdorf</a> (who wrote the foreward to the book) notes, most Christians have no idea how their faith should affect the <em>way</em> they work.</p>
<p>This has been something that Redeemer has devoted extensive time and energy to over the years, most notably through the work of the <a href="http://www.faithandwork.org/" target="_blank">Redeemer Center for Faith and Work</a>. In <em>Every Good Endeavour</em>, Keller sets out to coalesce the insights and reflections they have gained over the years in an effort to help Christians begin to understand their work from a biblical perspective.</p>
<p>Keller begins by stating that we need to recover the idea of work as a calling, and we can only begin to do this 'if [work] is reimagined as a mission of service to something beyond merely our own interests' (19). This includes what to many is the audacious idea that our work contributes something to the work that God is doing in the world. Yet he assures readers right from the beginning, 'If the God of the Bible exists...and this life is not the only life, then every good endeavour, even the simplest ones, pursued in response to God's calling, can matter forever' (29).</p>
<p>Working with the familiar creation-fall-redemption paradigm, the book begins by looking at God's plan for work. Keller helpfully takes the reader through a survey of what the Bible says about what work was designed to be. Work, he says, is part of God's good creation, and partaking in work is an integral part of what it means to be human. We have been called by God to cultivate the world, and this is an activity that all work contributes to in some meaningful way. Work is also marked by service, and we do our work both in service to God and in service to our neighbour and the human community. All of this means that there is great dignity in work.</p>
<p>Yet because of sin, we all know that work is often a trial and marked by much difficulty. Keller observes that we often find work to be a fruitless task, where little or nothing is accomplished even when we put in a great deal of effort. In addition, we can often feel that work is pointless and meaningless. The effects of sin extend to our perspectives of work as well, such as when we turn it into something selfish, focusing only on what we can get out of it. More, the idolatries of our culture filter into our work as well, shaping both the attitudes with which we approach work and the goals of our work. The original goodness of work has been distorted by sin.</p>
<p>As Christians, however, we know that Christ's redemption extends to all of creation, and thus redeems our work as well. We can now begin to come to a renewed understanding of work. As the gospel transforms us, Keller writes, we become shaped by an entirely different worldview, which informs everything, including our work. Christians recognise that God has placed them in their vocations for the purpose of participating in his work in the world. This is not some sort of mystical thing, but simply a recognition that our work is an instrument of God's providence in sustaining the world, and part of his common grace, by which he blesses all people. Our work, in many ways, simply keeps the world turning, and through our work, we serve others, and contribute to the flourishing of our communities and cities. Work also provides us with the opportunity to bear witness to Christ's rule over all as we work with different ethics and virtues, and a different view of humanity, all which have been shaped by Scripture. Ultimately, our work is an act of service to God, and because we have been redeemed, we are once again enabled to glorify him by fulfilling the calling he has given us to cultivate his world.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Keller records numerous stories and examples of Christians who have understood and put into practice the principles he sets forth, providing the reader with inspiration to think carefully about their own work and how they can apply this fresh understanding. As a further aid, he includes a number of sets of questions that help us establish a framework with which to view our work, in order that we begin to think about it from the right perspective.</p>
<p>I do not hesitate to say that this is probably the best book I read in 2012. And aware that far too many people say the following about far too many books, I nonetheless think that every pastor and church leader should read Keller's book, because it will be invaluable in discipling your congregation. Given that so much of our lives are spent working, it is critical that we recognise God's design for work and how Christ's redemption shapes our work. Not only that, but doing our work as Christians is also one of the most significant contributions we can make to the renewal of our cities and communities. In the end, the confession that Christ is Lord over all means that he is Lord over our work, and this book is a great help in thinking about what that looks like.</p>
