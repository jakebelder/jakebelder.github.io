<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted the following Monday. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of September together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>September 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/01/160386904/in-bike-friendly-copenhagen-highways-for-cyclists" target="_blank"><strong>In Bike-Friendly Copenhagen, Highways for Cyclists</strong></a> - Copenhagen is building a network of 'highways' for cyclists who go to and from the suburbs. It's a brilliant idea that enables cyclists to travel more easily and safely, and makes community by bicycle a much more viable option. Hopefully more cities latch on to this idea.</li>
<li><a href="http://apolojet.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/jesus-paul-and-the-gospel-of-the-gospels/" target="_blank"><strong>Jesus, John Piper, and the Gospel of the Gospels</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/JosephETorres" target="_blank">Joe Torres</a> posts a video clip from The Gospel Coalition in which John Piper, Don Carson, and Tim Keller discuss the gospel. And Joe suggests that Piper misses something key about the gospel.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://shoredfragments.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/egalitarianism-as-a-slippery-slope/" target="_blank">&lsquo;Egalitarianism&rsquo; as a slippery slope?</a></strong> -&nbsp; The idea that egalitarianism leads to liberalism is a common one, but <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveRHolmes" target="_blank">Steve Holmes</a> thinks the idea is flawed. Part of the reason he argues that it is a weak argument is because it's often based only on personal experience.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/r-e-a-d-s-l-o-w-l-y-absorb-argue-think/09/" target="_blank"><strong>R e a d S l o w l y, Absorb, Argue, Think</strong></a> - Sometimes it's important to just read a book very slowly.</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/convictions-of-an-octogenarian-minister-john-stott-reflects-on-60-years/" target="_blank"><strong>Convictions of an octogenarian minister: John Stott reflects on 60 years</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> scribbled down some notes on a talk Stott gave a few years ago on some of the things he has learned from his decades of ministry. He's posted them on his blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/abraham-kuyper-and-sphere-sovereignty/" target="_blank"><strong>Abraham Kuyper and Sphere Sovereignty</strong></a> - Here's a really helpful graphic <a href="http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/about-2/" target="_blank">Nelson Kloosterman</a> has put together to help make sense of sphere sovereignty.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vs2E8H8k1A&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Vanquish in Motion</a></strong> - I really like Aston Martins, and they often put together some great videos about their cars. Here's one about the new Vanquish, which might be the most beautiful car they've ever produced. It is a work of art.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.johnstackhouse.com/2012/09/14/of-course-it-matters-that-mitt-romney-is-a-mormon-2/" target="_blank">Of Course It Matters that Mitt Romney Is a Mormon</a></strong> - Republicans seem to be hesitatnt to talk about the fact that Romney is a Mormon. But <a href="http://twitter.com/jgsphd" target="_blank">John Stackhouse</a> says very clearly in this post that a politician's convictions matter a great deal, and those convictions need to factor in to our evaluation of a particular candidate.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theologicalmatters.com/index.php/2012/09/10/what-youll-never-hear-about-preaching-in-seminary/" target="_blank">What You&rsquo;ll Never Hear About Preaching in Seminary</a></strong> - While I found this ten-point list to interesting, I would approach it differently. I heard most of those points in seminary, but it wasn't until I started preaching that I really <em>understood</em> them.</li>
<li><a href="http://seesocs.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/welcome/" target="_blank"><strong>South East England School of Christian Studies</strong></a> - This exciting new venture is led by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeremy.ive" target="_blank">Jeremy Ive</a>, who has a real desire to see people shaped by the Reformational tradition. I certainly hope people will jump on board to take part in the new courses being offered.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/18/canada-rises-to-top-five-in-world-economic-freedom-ranking-as-u-s-plummets-to-18th/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada rises to top 5 in world economic freedom ranking as U.S. plummets to 18th</strong></a> - I don't really do economics, but I found this very interesting, especially when many American conservatives are so quick to label Canada 'socialist'. These statistics tell a different tale.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformedworship.org/article/march-2012/sanctification-ordinary-life" target="_blank"><strong>Sanctification for Ordinary Life</strong></a> - A great article by <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith" target="_blank">James K.A. Smith</a> on the importance of corporate worship and its role in preparing us for the worship of daily life. Smith writes, 'If all of life is worship, the sanctuary is the place where we learn how.'</li>
<li><a href="http://theaquilareport.com/thoughts-concerning-the-influence-of-the-anglican-tradition-on-contemporary-reformed-liturgical-practice/" target="_blank"><strong>Thoughts Concerning the Influence of the Anglican Tradition on Contemporary Reformed Liturgical Practice</strong></a> - This is an interesting article. The author looks at how features of worship in the Anglican tradition are starting to become more common in Reformed churches (particularly new plants), and suggests a few reasons why this is a good thing.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.christianitytoday.com/women/2012/09/adopting-a-kid-not-a-cause.html" target="_blank"><strong>Adopting a Kid, Not a Cause</strong></a> - I think that Christians should play a major role in fostering and adopting children, and I think it is something that certainly falls within the mission of the church. That being said, the author of this article makes a great point that sometimes we can turn adoption into a crusade and a child into a cause. She writes: "Adoption is a beautiful picture of God&rsquo;s redemption of us, his broken  children. And human adoption is a compassionate response to the divine  love that we ourselves have received. But I want to propose that adoptive parents don&rsquo;t have to be on a global  crusade. Whether they admit it or not, many Christian couples adopt  simply because they want kids. And that&rsquo;s okay. God thinks it&rsquo;s good to want kids." </li>
<li><a href="http://www.e-n.org.uk/6028-A-battle-I-face.htm" target="_blank"><strong>A battle I face</strong></a> - Evangelicals Now posted this interview with <a href="http://www.stebbes.org.uk/meet-staff-team/vaughan-roberts" target="_blank">Vaughan Roberts</a> this week about his struggles with same-sex attraction, on the back of the republishing of his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/185078728X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=185078728X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Battles Christians Face</em></a>. This is a courageous move by Roberts, and his honesty and his desire to be faithful to Scripture and to the Lord is refreshing and encouraging. Given the situation in the Church of England on this issue, it's also very important that Roberts has said what he did. This is really, really worth reading.</li>
