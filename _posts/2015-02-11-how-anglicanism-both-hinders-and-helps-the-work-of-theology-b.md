[Malcolm Brown](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-faith/mission/the-team.aspx) recently edited and contributed to a book entitled, *[Anglican Social Theology: Renewing the Vision Today](http://amzn.to/17hSdWw)*, which brings together a number of authors from different theological traditions to work towards developing a coherent social theology for the [Church of England](http://churchofengland.org). The book itself is well worth reading, but I was particularly interested by Brown's description of the Church of England in his opening chapter. He notes that the diversity of the Church presents certain challenges to developing a coherent social theology:

<blockquote>
[The Church of England] is a Church for the people of England: a Church created to unite a warring nation around a few basic shared texts and practices – most of all, the liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer. Despite many subsequent periods in which one wing of the Church has been hounded by another, it has sought to remain both Catholic and Reformed – a capacious Church rather than a Church where only middle-of-the-road beliefs are welcome. Today it might be described as a coalition of three parties. Each party has a project and, typically, each thinks its project the only one that counts. One project might be caricatured as that to complete the work of the Reformation. One project aims to complete the work of the Counter-Reformation. The third appears to be about completing the work of the Enlightenment. The three parties are the turbulent members of a complex coalition. But it any party or project succeeds to the exclusion of the others, the Church of England as the Church for all the nation will cease to be. No wonder that, to the frustration of many, the Church's internal structures…seem designed to stop things happening – the point is that the structures exist to stop any one party wiping out another (18-19).
</blockquote>

While he says this is a slightly tongue-in-cheek caricature of the Church, he also recognises that doing theology in this context can be difficult. However, he believes that the Church's diversity also has its merits, not least in the way each tradition can bring different questions to the table in the process of theological reflection. This is particularly important in what he calls the 'theological interim', the time we inhabit now 'between Pentecost and the Parousia, with the presence of the Holy Spirit among us but in a world still marred by the persistence of sin' (18). In that context, working together in the pursuit of truth is especially important:

<blockquote>
Anglicanism, interestingly, includes many whose allegiance to their party precludes the idea that such a coalition has any intrinsic value… But with the concept of the theological interim in mind, and the knowledge that, this side of the eschaton, Christians are not granted full knowledge of the mind of God, the coalition model is still one way to retain an awareness that the Church itself is a flawed institution that needs to hear the corrective influence of every strand of its own complex and confused tradition if it is to come close to God's truth (19).
</blockquote>

It is fitting that Brown makes these comments at the start of his book, because although [this cooperation in the pursuit of theological truth](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/why-anglicanism-makes-room-for-theological-exploration) (something that has been characteristic of Anglicanism for centuries) can often be a difficult and frustrating venture, it can also be a fruitful one – and his [book](http://amzn.to/17hSdWw), I'm pleased to say, demonstrates just that.
