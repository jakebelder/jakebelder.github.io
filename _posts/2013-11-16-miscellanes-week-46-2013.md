Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 275px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Stockholm_Tunnelbana_1.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>10-16 November 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/HSKdO0">The Myth that Religion is the Number One Cause of War</a></strong> – This myth is foundational to the objections of many people to religion, and to Christianity in particular. But the data in this interesting article makes it perfectly clear that it is historically inaccurate to say that the vast majority of wars are caused by religion.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/HQELwb">Glad Protestantism</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> responds to <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart's<a/> provocative post from last week, '<a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/11/the-end-of-protestantism">The End of Protestantism</a>', with some very helpful thoughts on why Leithart should have written his piece more carefully, particularly noting that the problem is not Protestantism as a whole, but ill-informed understandings of Protestantism. Sanders agrees with Leithart on numerous points, but suggests his strong and ill-conceived rhetoric ends up doing more harm than good. Leithart graciously accepted the correction <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/leithart/2013/11/11/deploring-whats-deplorable/">in a follow-up post</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17VaBnk">Why Europe matters</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor">Phil Whittall</a> recently moved to Stockholm to plant a church, and here he posts some significant facts about Europe to make the case for why it should be a focus for mission. I completely agree.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/HOCO2J">No One Wants Chaos: The Importance of Institutions</a></strong> – As I find myself in a context that often eyes institutions with suspicion, or fails to appreciate their importance, I'm grateful for posts like this in <a href="http://twitter.com/FieldnotesMag">Fieldnotes Magazine</a> which lay out some simple reasons why we should value institutions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hKPkAB">Christians 'face extinction' amid sectarian terror, minister warns</a></strong> – The UK Minister for Faith and Communities, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeeda_Warsi,_Baroness_Warsi">Sayeeda Warsi</a>, recently brought attention to the ongoing persecution of Christians, particularly in areas where they are being driven out, including across parts of the Middle East. That someone in government in the West would seek to make this public and call on others to work towards ending this injustice is indeed welcomed and commendable. The only thing I would want to point out to Baroness Warsi is that Jesus has promised that his church will never 'face extinction', no matter how fierce the persecution.</li>
