<p>In his book, <em>Gospel and Kingdom</em>, which is one of the volumes in the very helpful <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1842270362/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1842270362"><em>Goldsworthy Trilogy</em></a>, the Australian biblical theologian, <a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Graeme_Goldsworthy">Graeme Goldsworthy</a>, discusses how the understanding that the Old Testament forms an integral part of the history of redemption has been lost in our day. We have moved towards focusing on the individual and his or her personal appropriation of faith instead of first recognising the work of God in history as part of a much larger story and framework. He writes,</p>
<blockquote>
Failure to grasp this truth &ndash; largely because the proper study of the Old Testament has been neglected, has aided and abetted one of the most unfortunate reversals in evangelical theology. The core of the gospel, the historical facts of what God did in Christ, is often <em>down-graded</em> today in favour of a more mystical emphasis on the private spiritual experience of the individual. Whereas faith in the gospel is essentially acceptance of, and commitment to, the declaration that God acted in Christ some two thousand years ago on our behalf, saving faith is often portrayed nowadays more as trust in what God is doing in us now. Biblical ideas such as 'the forgiveness of sins' or 'salvation' are interpreted as primarily describing a Christian's personal experience. But when we allow the whole Bible &ndash; Old and New Testaments &ndash; to speak to us, we find that those subjective aspects of the Christian life which are undoubtedly important &ndash; the new birth, faith and sanctification &ndash; are <em>fruits</em> of the gospel. This gospel, while still relating to individual people at their point of need, is rooted and grounded in the history of redemption. It is the good news <em>about</em> Jesus, before it can become good news for sinful men and women. Indeed, it is only as the <em>objective</em> (redemptive-historical) facts are grasped that the <em>subjective</em> experience of the individual Christian can be understood (20-21).
</blockquote>

Without the redemptive work of God in history through Jesus, we have no hope. This work of God is the starting point of faith.
