Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 276px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/New-Testament-Greek-008.jpg" width="400"></div>
Here are the links from the week of <strong>28 September-04 October 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1nD3qIg">Daily Dose of Greek</a></strong> – If you have studied biblical Greek before and are looking for a simple way to keep up with it, this new resource looks quite helpful. A two-minute video is emailed to you each day in which a verse is translated on screen so that you can follow along and keep your skills fresh.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZmDmpX">What's wrong with being Gospel-Centred?</a></strong> – Nothing is wrong with being gospel-centred, says <a href="http://twitter.com/PastorSteveJeff">Steve Jeffrey</a> – unless your gospel is too small. This is a great post on the need for a gospel that focuses on the Lordship of Christ and his cosmic redemption.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mTe5xI">NT Wright and the Historical Adam</a></strong> – I find the whole question of the historical Adam to be an interesting and important question, and it is always interesting to read what other scholars think on the matter. Here is a summary of Wright's view on the issue, which, although it has some helpful points, feels to me a bit evasive.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1nOTXxz">Church as (non-nuclear) family</a></strong> – Here is an interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/SteveRHolmes">Steve Holmes</a> on what it actually means and looks like for the church to be a 'family'.</li>
