Over the past few weeks I have been leading an adult Sunday School class on worship, which has turned out to be quite an adventure.  Of course, since worship is at the very core of who we are as humans (<a href="http://www.shortercatechism.com/resources/wsc/wsc_001.html">WSC 1</a>), it follows that people should be so inclined to want to talk about it.

This past Sunday, our discussion turned to Reformed and Presbyterian worship.  Because the church is a member of the <a href="http://www.pcanet.org/">Presbyterian Church in America</a> (PCA), it was important to me that we talk about worship in our own tradition.  Quite a number of the people in our church do not come from that background, and so I thought it especially important that they spend some time learning about how worship (specifically public or corporate worship, in this instance) is understood in the Reformed tradition.

Back in April, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/some-thoughts-on-tradition-and-worship">that topic came up on this blog</a> and generated more comments and interaction that I have ever had in five years of blogging.  The discussion of Reformed worship centers on what is called the Regulative Principle of Worship (RPW), which basically says that in regards to public worship, whatever is not commanded in Scripture is forbidden.  Essentially, the point is that only the sovereign God can determine how He is to be worshiped, and He has clearly revealed to us in His Word how we are to do that.  In the comments to the post in April, I indicated that I had difficulties with this principle, but I must admit I spoke a little hastily.  I have difficulty with some <span style="font-style: italic;">interpretations</span> of the principle, not the general principle in and of itself.

Needless to say, this functioned as the bone of contention Sunday morning, for a number of reasons.  For one, all of us are products of Western culture, a culture which dislikes both authority and rules and wants to be able to set its own terms for everything, including for what worship should look like.  To many, the RPW seems to be just that&mdash;a bunch of rules and restrictions that hinder our ability to worship and allow the Holy Spirit to move and work among us.

Second, people approach worship with entirely subjective ideas of the true, good, and beautiful. Many come to the discussion with the presumption that the things they think constitute worship are valid on the grounds of their subjective reasoning alone.  If they feel that a certain element evokes a powerful response in them, then it must be appropriate.  But the sheer audacity of this is immediately clear, and the question again surfaces: who are we to tell God&mdash;the One by whom all standards of truth, goodness, and beauty are measured&mdash;what is appropriate for worship?  Can we seriously believe that <span style="font-style: italic;">our</span> conceptions of these things are sufficiently equal to the One who <span style="font-style: italic;">created</span> them?

Third, almost all recognition of the authority of tradition has been done away with in evangelical churches. In part, this can be attributed to a reaction to the descent into traditionalism by some bodies.  More to the point, however, this springs from the same "me- and-my-Bible" individualism and relativism wherein we choose to locate authority today.  What needs to be recovered is the acknowledgment that the individual is part of something much bigger than himself.  I emphasized Sunday morning that we as a Presbyterian church are heirs to a very rich tradition, one to which we owe a great deal.  A specific understanding of worship is one of the things that comes out of this tradition.

It would be a great mistake to not honor the tremendous diligence and devotion with which our Reformed forebears studied the Bible in order to pass down to us the sum of what Scripture teaches for the life of the believer and the Church (in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Standards">Westminster Standards</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Forms_of_Unity">Three Forms of Unity</a>). Appealing to the confessional documents, though, will usually prompt the reaction that their teaching, on worship in this instance, is just a product of historical context or circumstance.  Granted, a healthy sense of the authority of tradition carries with it an implicit understanding that we do not hold to these teachings blindly. But a far bigger danger is to run headlong into an understanding of worship premised on the authority of subjectivity.  The fact remains that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/reading-scripture-with-the-church">theology must be done in community</a>, and the authority of the church should always be held above that of the individual.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a>, in his <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/encyclopediaofsa00unknuoft"><span style="font-style: italic;">Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology: Its Principles</span></a>, writes about the authority of the Church's traditions and confessions, and says that every theologian must reckon with the things taught by the history of the church, and &ldquo;must take the dogmas of his church as his guide, and that he shall not diverge from them until he is compelled to do this by the Word of God&rdquo; (577).  We must begin, Kuyper says, with the assumption that the Church is <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>.  For this reason the theologian should not view the confession as mere opinion over against his, but should recognize that the confession of the Church does not just presume to be true, it carries objective authority by virtue of the guidance of the Spirit (591).

Now, this creates a problem for those who have joined a local church who are not of Presbyterian or Reformed persuasion.  In our church, we have a number of these.  Membership in the PCA does not require subscription to the Westminster Standards, and so members do not need to adhere to the RPW in this case.  However&mdash;and this is a point that is seldom emphasized&mdash;in becoming members of the church people <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> required to submit to the authority of the local church and to recognize that the church is constitutionally-bound, by virtue of its membership in the denomination, to uphold the teachings and theology of the denomination.  What does this mean for the member in regards to this issue?  In essence it means that if your theology of worship does not conform to that of the PCA, you are not allowed to subvert the authority of the church by raising a dissenting voice.  Naturally, in this culture and in modern evangelicalism, this does not sit well.

While there are rules governing worship in the PCA because of its adherence to the RPW, a fair amount of liberty in working out the details of the principle is still granted.  The <a href="http://www.pcaac.org/BCO%202008/BCO%202008%20Reprint%20for%20Web%207-3-08.pdf">Book of Church Order</a> 47-6, says,

<blockquote>
The Lord Jesus Christ has prescribed no fixed forms for public worship but, in the interest of life and power in worship, has given His Church a large measure of liberty in this matter. It may not be forgotten, however, that there is true liberty only where the rules of God&rsquo;s Word are observed and the Spirit of the Lord is, that all things must be done decently and in order, and that God&rsquo;s people should serve Him with reverence and in the beauty of holiness. From its beginning to its end a service of public worship should be characterized by that simplicity which is an evidence of sincerity and by that beauty and dignity which are a manifestation of holiness.
</blockquote>

In working through this issue, I came across a <a href="http://www.challies.com/archives/articles/advent-candles.php">post Tim Challies wrote in November of 2006</a>, in which he pointed out the important distinction between the <span style="font-style: italic;">elements</span> of worship and the <span style="font-style: italic;">circumstances</span> of worship.  The elements are the non-negotiables dictated by Scripture, while the circumstances can be equated with the forms mentioned in the portion of the BCO cited above.  In the PCA that means, for example, that while singing is a required element of worship, the circumstance or form of that element (such as singing exclusively Psalms or incorporating contemporary music) is a matter of liberty to be decided by the local congregation.

As good as that sounds, in some sense I think it creates further problems.  This is particularly the case when you begin to discuss aspects of worship in the Old Testament, for two reasons.  One, it raises the question of what parts of worship belong to the dictates of the ceremonial law.  But second, it raises a question of the nature of the ceremonial law itself&mdash;if the ceremonial law is abrogated today, does this necessarily entail that all its teaching on worship falls under the rubric of that which is forbidden in the RPW?  Without a doubt we would wholeheartedly affirm that certain parts of it are, such as the sacrificial elements.  But what about the music the Israelites employed in worship?  What about David's dancing before the Lord (2 Sam. 6:14)?

I am going to leave that aside for now.  To round this discussion off, I want to point out that while the RPW has often been perceived as legalistic and restrictive, there is a sense in which it is actually <span style="font-style: italic;">freeing</span>.  Just as we are most free when we submit our hearts to God and seek to live according to His will and rule, so we are most free in our worship when we submit to His rule for worship.  The BCO is exactly right on that point: "There is true liberty only where the rules of God&rsquo;s Word are observed and the Spirit of the Lord is."

Worship is not about us; it never is.  It is all about Him.  If we come to understand that and begin to seek only His will for worship, recognizing that only in doing His will do we truly glorify Him, then we will begin to faithfully worship our God.  Many people talk about wanting to feel the presence and movement of the Holy Spirit in worship, but the only guarantee of that is to worship in spirit and in truth as God has revealed to us in His Word.  Submission and surrender may be unpopular notions in our day, but there is absolutely no freedom in autonomy.  And therein lies the heart of Reformed worship.
