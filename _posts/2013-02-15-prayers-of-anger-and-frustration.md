This is from a footnote in [Peter Leithart's](http://twitter.com/PLeithart) [commentary on 1 & 2 Kings](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0334040981/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0334040981&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21), but I think the point is significant for Christians who hesitate to express their true feelings in prayer for fear of praying irreverently:
<blockquote>
The rhetoric of Elijah's prayer in 1 Kings 17:20 is noteworthy. The widow comes with an accusation against Elijah, and ultimately against God, and when Elijah prays, he takes up her accusation: 'O Yahweh my God, have you brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?' Elijah does not refrain from expressing his anguish and the bitterness. There is no pious softening as he takes up the widow's complaint as his own. God does not need to be protected from our fury, rage, and disappointment, as if they can be hidden away from his sight. Saints express their anguish and frustration openly. They express their rage at sin and its effects and their dismay that God has not yet acted to correct it. 'How long, O Lord?' is a characteristic prayer of the Psalms.
</blockquote>
We all know that the world is not the way it is supposed to be, and it is perfectly acceptable for us to express to God our anger and frustration about it. Far from being irreverent, this is the way we draw close to God and seek his comfort in the midst of the brokenness that surrounds us. This broken world and the reality we live in only begins to make sense in the One who sent his only Son to do all that was necessary to set this world right again.
