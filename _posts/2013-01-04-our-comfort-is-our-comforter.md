<p>The <a href="http://crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a>, that well-known and well-loved confession from the mid-16th century (in fact, this year marks its 450th anniversary), famously begins by asking, 'What is your only comfort in life and in death?' The answer is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
That I am not my own,<br>
but belong –<br>
body and soul,<br>
in life and in death –<br>
to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood,<br>
and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.<br>
He also watches over me in such a way<br>
that not a hair can fall from my head<br>
without the will of my Father in heaven:<br>
in fact, all things must work together for my salvation.<br>
<br>
Because I belong to him,<br>
Christ, by his Holy Spirit,<br>
assures me of eternal life<br>
and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready<br>
from now on to live for him.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>It is easy to read that answer with a focus on all the benefits afforded the individual through Christ, and to locate the source of comfort there. However, the German-Swiss theologian, <a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ebusch/welcome-e.htm" target="_blank">Eberhard Busch</a>, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802863787/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802863787" target="_blank"><em>Drawn to Freedom</em></a>, a sort of commentary on the Catechism, wants us to understand that this is not where the Catechism ultimately intends us to find comfort. He writes,</p>
<blockquote>
The main sentence of this answer goes: This is my comfort &ndash; not something, not a thing, and not any idea that I can 'have', but a person, a subject, who is facing me, who steps toward me and meets me, who turns to me and speaks to me. My comfort is my <em>Comforter</em>... Comfort consists in someone's sticking with us and holding us fast so that we cannot be dropped... Comfort is Christ himself, who offers himself to us so reliably that we can totally rely on it.<br><br>

...It is Christ himself who holds us in his hand and does not let us go. My comfort is that I 'both body and soul' (in all dimensions of space, not only spiritually-inwardly-mentally, that too, but also publicly and bodily), 'in life and in death' (in all dimensions of time, in the splendid hours and in the nights, in the middle and at the limits of existence) &ndash; in short, that I whether I realize it or not, in each and every dimension, am not fallen or withdrawn from my faithful Savior, but have fallen into his arms and have been drawn to him. It is he who promises good to me, and for my good says, 'I am with you!' What he says is comforting because he says it; all comfort for body and soul, in living and dying, lies in the fact that he promises this to us. What he promises says something to the You who is spoken to, but first something about the I who is speaking &ndash; the divine I in the Savior Jesus Christ. About the You it says: you will not be alone, will not be without me. And about the I it says: It is my will not to be alone, not to be without you.

<p>Busch's remarks are very helpful. I would make a few observations on what he says. First, he makes an implicit reference to the covenant here (and since he is from a Reformed background, I will assume it is intentional), which I think is significant. The Catechism, of course, does not use the word in this first question and answer, but the emphasis on belonging and on the work of Christ in ensuring and guaranteeing all God's promises, particularly his promise that he will be our God and we will be his people, which Busch draws attention to above, certainly bears the marks of a covenantal theology. The knowledge that God has sworn by himself to bless his people, and that the person of Jesus Christ is the one who comes to do all that is necessary for us, as covenant-breakers, to remain in the covenant and receive those blessings, is of immense comfort. Jesus is the ultimate covenant keeper, and he keeps that covenant on our behalf.</p>
<p>Related to this is the certainty of Christ's spoken word of promise, which Busch also helpfully highlights. The certainty of the salvation that comes through Christ, while clearly demonstrated in his death and resurrection, is also made certain by the word of promise. Prior to his coming, the promises of a Messiah spoken by God beforehand ensured the coming of the Messiah and the definitive nature of his redeeming work. This is why the prophets, as God's messengers, could speak with such certainty about the salvation that would come through the Messiah, and why in Luke's gospel, Mary and Zechariah could say with confidence that redemption had come.</p>
<p>When Jesus comes, his own words, spoken during his earthly ministry, carry this same certainty as well. The promises of God to bless his people are sure simply because of who he is. Jesus' words too, then, because he is fully God, are entirely trustworthy. When he says, as in John 10:10, 'I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full,' we can know with confidence that, by faith in him, we will inherit the life that is promised. His acts of pronouncing the forgiveness of sins and declaring the sick healed clearly demonstrate the power and efficacy of his words. And so we find comfort in hearing the Saviour's certain words of redemption and salvation.</p>

The point that Busch is making is that we must love and cherish Jesus himself, and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/80709040" target="_blank">not just some idea about him</a>. The Catechism wants us to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, for our hope, our joy, and our comfort is found only in our Comforter.
