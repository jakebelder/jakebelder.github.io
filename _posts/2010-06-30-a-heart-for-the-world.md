<p>A few weeks ago I was on a plane, and sitting a few seats over across the aisle from me was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi">Haredi Jew</a>. I had seen Haredis before, but for whatever reason, I was intrigued by the man and spent a portion of the flight watching him. He read quite a bit from a book printed in Hebrew and at one point he was even working on a paper or some other document in Hebrew on his laptop. When they served the food they had a special kosher meal for him, which did not look all that appetizing (apparently his thought too, as he barely ate any of it).</p>
<p>As I watched him fiddle around with the food, I suddenly found myself a little frustrated, and I wanted to grab him by the shoulders, give him a good shake and say to him, "Why don't you get it? How can you immerse yourself in the Tanakh and not see that Jesus <em>is</em> the Messiah? How can you not understand?" After we landed and he went off to baggage claim I stood there for a moment watching him walk away as the thought continued to roll through my mind.</p>
<p>This past Sunday our adult Sunday School class was studying Romans 9, a passage in which Paul struggles with a similar frustration. His frustration is much greater than mine, however, since he laments the failure of his own people to put their faith in Christ as the promised Messiah. As we looked at the passage, I was struck by an element of Paul's struggle that was entirely lacking in mine. He says, in Romans 9:1-5,</p>
<blockquote>
I speak the truth in  Christ&mdash;I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit&mdash; I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from  Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, the people of Israel.  Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants,  the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human  ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
</blockquote>
<p>When Paul thinks of the Jews, he has "great sorrow and unceasing anguish" in his heart. How great this anguish must be if he nearly wishes himself cursed and cut off from Christ for their sake!</p>
<p>It is to my shame that I did not feel sorrow and anguish for the Jewish man on the plane. Yet I shouldn't just feel sorrow for this particular Jewish man, or the Jewish people in general, but all those throughout the world who don't know the Lord. That sorrow comes more naturally, perhaps, if we are talking about those close to us who aren't believers, but when we start to think about those much more distant from us, both relationally and physically, it's much easier to let our thoughts pass over them.</p>
<p>Not so with Paul. He devoted his life to proclaiming the gospel to the world, and while he here confesses his anguish for the Jews, his life made it evident that he felt this sorrow for all those who did not profess faith in Christ. I am not saying, of course, that we all need to be career missionaries, but only that our hearts would be filled with the same love and compassion for the people in this world.</p>

Lord, give us the heart of Paul that we too may earnestly desire to make the gospel of Jesus Christ known to the nations.
