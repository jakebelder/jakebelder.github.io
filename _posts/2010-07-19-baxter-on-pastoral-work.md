<p>One of the best known works of the Puritan minister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Baxter">Richard Baxter</a>, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Pastor-Richard-Baxter/dp/0851511910/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1279493811&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The Reformed Pastor</em></a>, written around 1656 while he was vicar of St Mary's Church in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidderminster">Kidderminster</a>. The content had originally been composed by him for an association of ministers from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, and Baxter had intended the book to help them in their efforts to form godly, worshiping communities in that county.</p>
<p>Having been on my shelf for some time (and now that I am post-serminary and thus afforded time to read whatsoever I desire), I began to read the book the other day. I was immediately taken by something in Baxter's dedication, where he urged his fellow ministers to be intimately involved in the lives of their parishioners. The responsibilities of a pastor went beyond what took place during a Sunday service; it included the nurture of the families and individuals within the congregation, visiting with them to teach, admonish, and encourage them in the faith. Baxter makes six points in regard to these responsibilites (slightly paraphrased here):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>People must be taught the principles of religion, and matters of greatest necessity to salvation.</li>
<li>They must be taught it in the most edifying, advantageous way.</li>
<li>Personal conference, examination, and instruction, hath many excellent advantages for their good.</li>
<li>Personal instruction is recommended to us by Scripture, and by the practice of the servants of Christ, and approved by the godly of all ages.</li>
<li>We should perform this great duty to all the people, or as many as we can; for our love and care of their souls must extend to all. If there are five hundred or a thousand ignorant people in your parish or congregation, it is a poor discharge of your duty, now and then to speak to some few of them, and to let the rest alone in their ignorance, if you are able to afford them help.</li>
<li>It is not less certain, that so great a work as this is should take up a considerable part of our time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This being only the dedication, Baxter does not elaborate on the points made, but something of the importance he attaches to this aspect of pastoral work comes out already in this short list. Just a few pages later, however, he issues a far more urgent plea to ministers for engaging in pastoral work among their flock:</p>
<blockquote>
You have put your hand to the plough; you are doubly devoted to [God], as Christians, and as pastors; and dare you, after this, draw back and refuse his work? You see the work of reformation at a stand; and you are engaged by many obligations to promote it: and dare you now neglect the means by which it must be done? Will you show your faces in a Christian congregation, as ministers of the gospel, and there pray for a reformation, and for the conversion and salvation of your hearers, and for the prosperity of the Church; and when you have done, refuse to use the means by which all this must be effected?
</blockquote>
<p>Baxter continues by saying that this aspect of their work as ministers is just as important as their preaching. This kind of involvement in the lives of the members of a congregation fosters a relationship in which the minister demonstrates great love and care for the parishioner and, in turn, the parishioner is given to humbly respect and submit to the authority of the minister. Now, this is not a totalitarian sort of authority, but the authority of one who has been called by God to shepherd his flock in a certain place. The authority is not derived from himself, but from his call and ordination to faithfully teach and proclaim the whole counsel of God. And his carrying out of this work is solely for the purpose of nurturing the faith of the congregation, for building them up and edifying them in order that they might increasingly live for the glory of the Lord, and as faithful witnesses to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For this reason, a minister's work does not take place only within an hour and a half time slot on a Sunday morning; in reality, it is a task that is never crossed off his 'to-do' list. Baxter understood the gravity and immensity of the minister's calling, and that is why he wrote this book. I am really looking forward to going deeper in this book and learning from Baxter's pastoral wisdom.</p>

In a day or two, I will return to this issue with some thoughts on the place of this type of pastoral work in the church today.
