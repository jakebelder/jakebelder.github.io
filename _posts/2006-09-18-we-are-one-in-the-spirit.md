Today I felt true joy as a Christian. I was privileged to watch a Liberian family be baptized into the family of God. What incredible joy it brings to see the church of God grow and to be witness to its diversity.

<blockquote>
There is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents (Luke 15:10).
</blockquote>

And there is rejoicing on earth as well. The family comes to Canada as refugees from Liberia, and made their way here after a period of stay in Ghana. Now several years later they find themselves becoming members of a city church in the downtown of a Canadian industrial city, with a membership of people primarily from Dutch descent, yet feeling entirely at home in their midst, and ready and willing to serve God alongside of them. What an awesome God we truly do serve.
