<p>I have been slowly reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Martyr-Reader-Patrick-Donnelly/dp/0943549752/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206627343&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Peter Martyr Reader</em></a>, a collection of writings from the early-16th century Italian reformer, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Martire_Vermigli">Peitro Martire Vermigli</a>.  The first chapter of the book is Vermigli's commentary on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed">Apostles' Creed</a>.  Having an interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiology">ecclesiology</a>, I found his section dealing with the phrase, "I believe in the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints" to be quite interesting, especially given his context as a reformer <em>within</em> the medieval Catholic Church.  He says a lot of good things, and I think I will stretch them out over a couple of posts.  I'll start with this:</p>

<blockquote>
When one considers the earthly and carnal nature of professing Christians, the Church appears to be composed of varied and diverse peoples as distant from one another as are the several provinces of the world.  Yet the Church is bound together, connected, and well structured.  Paul rightly compares it to a body when writing to the Ephesians and the Corinthians [<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:19-23&amp;version=47;">Eph. 1:19-23</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2012:12-27&amp;version=47;">1 Cor. 12:12-27</a>].  But by what power are Christians gathered and linked together, since they differ in natural complexion, language, and location?  Whatever the diversity, the secret of community is revealed in the link between these articles of faith: first, we confess the Holy Spirit; then we think of the body of the faithful brought together by him.  He unites everyone in the world who, with integrity and sincerity, trusts in the name of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />

The Greek term [ἐ&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;ί&alpha;, which is] translated "church" means a multitude called together.  It is composed of all who are drawn to faith in Christ by the Holy Spirit...we believe that the company of the faithful, the community of saints, is gathered not by the will of man or any worldly scheme, but by the Spirit of Christ.  Although scattered in various places, the Church is one because of a common faith (34-35).
</blockquote>

This is one of those things that I think we as Christians innately know, but perhaps take for granted.  Human nature is such that our personalities clash with others and we have difficulty getting along with some people more than others.  It is no different within the Church.  Perhaps a reminder that the Holy Spirit has brought us together because of our shared identity in the person of Jesus Christ is welcome in more than a few churches.  Furthermore, on a global scale, an emphasis on the Church as a single unit around the world that transcends time and space is desperately needed.  What an incredible thing that the Spirit would unite the children of God into a visible structure that is real and tangible, that we can be a participate in.  Should we not rejoice in this and celebrate our commonalities?  "For you are all one in Christ Jesus" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.%203:28&amp;version=47;">Gal. 3:28</a>).  May this truth show forth in His Church.
