<p>Given <a href="http://timothykeller.com/author/">Tim Keller's</a> ability to communicate clearly and powerfully as a preacher, it was only natural that a tweet like the one above would garner quite a bit of attention.</p>

This didn't particularly surprise me, though. While I think that preaching classes do have merit, particularly in terms of the help they can provide in honing homiletical and exegetical skills, I tend to agree with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_Lloyd-Jones">Martyn Lloyd-Jones</a> that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/preaching-classes-are-useless">preaching is something which cannot be taught</a>.
