Every once in a while, I either come to a point where I feel as if I have nothing to say or I have so much going on in my head that I don't know what to say.  In the last few weeks it has been the latter, hence the relative infrequency of posting here.

In the interim, then, I offer this delightfully inflammatory quote from one of the essays in <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">James K. A. Smith's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802864074?tag=jameskasmithc-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0802864074&amp;adid=0EP91NN55B4YDS42TN56&amp;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Devil Reads Derrida</span></a>, as a filler.  Personally, I tend to opt for subtle provocation, but since this is a quote, I (somewhat) absolve myself of responsibility for what is said&mdash;though, I should add, for the most part I agree with the analysis.  This particular essay focuses on some of the arguments in <a href="http://www.gregboyd.org/">Greg Boyd's</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Christian-Nation-Political-Destroying/dp/0310267307"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Myth of a Christian Nation</span></a>.  Let me anticipate what might be going through your mind&mdash;ultimately he takes Boyd to task for constructing his arguments on a number of false premises; it is the larger overall points with which he resonates.

Smith begins with a brief discussion of some of the evangelical figures who, in the early 1970s, began to make American Christians aware of the fact that they lived with a duality, one that had them altogether focused on redeeming the souls of individuals at the expense of redeeming the rest of the created order.  Richard Mouw, for example, "invited evangelicals to take up the Cultural Mandate as a complement to, and expression of, the Great Commission."  Only, it didn't quite go as planned.
<blockquote>
A funny thing happened on the way to the Capitol.  If [people like] Mouw were trying to pull evangelicals back from their isolation out on the pietist end of the pendulum's arc, they didn't likely anticipate the degree to which the pendulum would swing the other way...In fact, evangelicals became such zealous converts to the Cultural Mandate that it has pretty much trumped the Great Commission.  Christians leaders spend more time worrying about activist judges, Venezuelan dictators, and constitutional amendments than their evangelical forebears could ever have imagined.  Devoting themselves to political strategizing and marshaling the machinations of government, evangelicals have so embraced participation in the 'earthly city' that one wonders whether they've lost their passport to the City of God.  Worse yet is the suspicion that evangelicals in America have just collapsed the two, such that the City of God is just downright confused with America as a city set on a hill...[We must denounce] the nationalistic 'idolatry' of American evangelicalism which fuses the kingdom of God with a preferred, made-in-America version of the kingdom of the world, confusing and conflating the cross and the flag (98-99).
</blockquote>

As I said above, I agree with the overall point being made, though I would make a few qualifications.  However, this is not the time to get into those, lest this turn into something of a tome.  Ultimately, what Smith is attempting to bring out is that American evangelicalism is characterized by an over-realized eschatology.  One need not look any further than the pervasive rhetoric of superiority, the quasi-divinization of the Founding Fathers (or Reagan, for that matter), and the unquestioning ascent to the supposed biblical principles of the Constitution to see the evidence of this.

By no means should Christians abdicate their responsibilities with respect to the cultural mandate; Smith is not advocating a return to isolationist pietism.  Neither is he vilifying America or its principles (nor do I).  Instead, this is meant to remind Christians that our citizenship in the Kingdom of God and resultant designation as resident aliens in this world calls us first and foremost to the task of being ambassadors of the King, of being a sign and foretaste of His Kingdom and bearing witness to the rule of our Sovereign Lord over all of creation.  It is to this Lord that every knee shall one day bow.

I have stirred the pot with the ladle that is Smith (and Boyd) long enough.  What do you think?
