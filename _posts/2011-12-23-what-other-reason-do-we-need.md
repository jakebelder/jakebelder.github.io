<p>I've often wondered why Psalm 117 is so short, just two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">Praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>, all you nations; </span><br /><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extol him, all you peoples. </span><br /><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">For great is his love toward us, </span><br /><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the faithfulness of the </span><span style="color: #5d5d5d;"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span></span><span style="color: #5d5d5d;"> endures forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">Praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as I was reading it this morning it struck me that nothing more needs to be said. What other reason do we need to praise God than his great love toward us and his enduring faithfulness?</p>

Incidentally, I discovered that Psalm 117 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_117">the middle chapter of the Bible</a>, according to the chapter division our Bibles use. Fitting, I think, that the central chapter of the Bible is a call to all people to praise the Lord.
