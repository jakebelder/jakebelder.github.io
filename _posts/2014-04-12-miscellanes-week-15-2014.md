Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>06-12 April 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/PFBZh0">Everything You Hate About Advertising In One Fake Video. This Is Amazingly Real</a></strong> – This is quite amusing, but also insightful into the tactics advertisers use to get our attention and play on our desires.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lN6fUJ">Law, morality and difficult love</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/MartinBDavie">Martin Davie</a> looks at the recent change in marriage law here in the UK and how we ought to respond as Christians. He talks about the need for 'difficult love', saying, 'Love is not the same as unconditional affirmation. Love means valuing every single human as someone made in the image and likeness of God and for whom Christ died, and acting in a way that gives expression to that value. This frequently means challenging people about their behaviour so that they can change where necessary and so become more fully the people God intends them to be.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mY40vd">The Archbishop, Gay Marriage & Violence: What are the issues?</a></strong> – The Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://twitter.com/JustinWelby">Justin Welby</a>, made some very interesting (and provocative) comments in a radio interview last week about the whole issue of same-sex marriage and the repercussions of our actions on the wider Christian world. In response to those who thoroughly misunderstood Welby and charged him with a sort of 'moral blackmail', <a href="http://twitter.com/goddardaj">Andrew Goddard</a> here helpfully unpacks Welby's comments and the significant ethical issues he was raising.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ejizKa">7 observations & 3 challenges for Newfrontiers</a></strong> –  Here's an interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor">Phil Whittall</a>, a Newfrontiers leader in Sweden, on the current state of Newfrontiers and what they need to think about to move forward. I think Newfrontiers could become a big player in UK evangelicalism in the near future. They've got an increasing number of really thoughtful leaders, they are growing, they are just getting on planting churches all over the place, and in general, there is just a lot they are doing that is encouraging.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hs0IRw">Death Before the Fall</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> has a very thoughtful post here on what is an interesting and tricky question. I think this is one of the most helpful things I've read on this question.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hsxx0C">Why Can’t My Son Receive the Eucharist?</a></strong> – Here is an interesting article about recovering the practice of infant communion. It comes from a Roman Catholic perspective, but is an interesting appeal to the historic practice of the Church.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hvdkHA">The Freedom to Love</a></strong> – This is a helpful post on why we need to stop buying into the notion that love equals sex. We need to recover the idea of robust, intimate, loving relationships that can function fully without sex. This, as a result, could be one of the ways we can help people who choose celibacy for the sake of faithfulness to avoid isolation and loneliness.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hvefYx">Inescapable Blood</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> has a very interesting post on the theme of blood in Matthew's Gospel. He writes, 'Jesus’ blood is inescapable. Everyone...is going to come under the blood of Jesus, one way or another. It is going to be charged against those who conspire to kill Jesus, or it is going to be the blood of the covenant, shed for the forgiveness of sins, for those who turn to Jesus. Either way, the blood will be on you and your children. Those who try to remove it, throw it away, wash it off – those are the ones who are doomed. Those who receive Jesus’ blood will have robes of white washed in the blood of the Lamb.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hoUrVG">Church attendance manual (1): arriving late</a></strong> – The often-witty <a href="http://twitter.com/FaithTheology">Ben Myers</a> is at it again with some suggestions of how to act when you arrive late to church, depending on what tradition you belong to. This is fantastic.</li>
