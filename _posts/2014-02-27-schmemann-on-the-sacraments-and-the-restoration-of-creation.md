[Alexander Schmemann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Schmemann), in his book, *[Of Water and the Spirit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0913836109/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0913836109&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, makes a note on the relationship between the sacraments and the restoration of creation:

<blockquote>
Christ came not to <em>replace</em> 'natural' matter with some 'supernatural' and sacred matter, but to <em>restore</em> it and to fulfil it as the means of communion with God. The holy water in Baptism, the bread and wine in the Eucharist, stand for, i.e. <em>represent</em> the whole of creation, but creation as it will be at the <em>end</em>, when it will be consummated in God, when He will fill all things with Himself (49).
</blockquote>
