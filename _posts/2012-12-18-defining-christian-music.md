<p>As a young teenager growing up in a very conservative Dutch Reformed  context, I often heard older people loudly declare that rock  music was of the devil. Anyone who grew up in evangelical circles in the past fifty years or so would likely have heard similar things. My friends and I, wanting to justify listening to bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Adrenaline" target="_blank">Audio Adrenaline</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_Talk" target="_blank">DC Talk</a>, often fell back on arguments like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Warren" target="_blank">Rick Warren</a>, pastor of the American megachurch, <a href="http://www.saddleback.com/" target="_blank">Saddleback Church</a>, in California, put forward last week:</p>

<p>This remains a popular line of reasoning with Christians, and fifteen years ago I would have happily retweeted it in symbolic endorsement of the argument. But I struggle a lot now with what Warren is suggesting, particularly because of my understanding of the doctrine of creation.</p>

Many Christians have a narrow view of creation that does not go beyond the physical stuff that we can see and touch. However, the Bible repeatedly asserts that God is the creator of all of life, and thus creation encompasses the whole of our creaturely existence, including the norms and laws and structures that God has woven into the fabric of reality that guide and give shape to our life on this earth and enable us to live in conformity with his will. What is problematic in Warren's tweet, then, is the idea that the forms in which the lyrics of songs are communicated to us have no significance. If this is true, the underlying assertion is that music is not something that is normed by the laws and structures of creation, and ultimately, the conclusion must be drawn that God is not sovereign over music.

To be sure, the idea of music being normed by the laws and structures of creation is a very complicated one, because it is exceedingly difficult to define what that actually looks like. All of us are aware that there is a great deal of bad music out there, and many of us will probably agree on what that is. But what does good music sound like? That is a very difficult question to answer, not least because each of us has different opinions and tastes when it comes to music. I do not intend to enter into an exhaustive discussion of that question here, nor to I intend to put forward any suggestions as to what the answer(s) might be.

With the aim of setting up something of a framework in which to discuss these things, however, let me say that I believe the starting point of this conversation is the concept of beauty. Good music is often judged by whether or not we consider it to be beautiful and pleasing to the ear. For this reason, we need to begin by asking the more fundamental question of what beauty is. Can it be defined? Or Is it, as our culture suggests, entirely subjective, a matter of beauty being in the eye (or in this case, the ear) of the beholder?

Far from it. As theologians down through the centuries have argued, our standards of beauty must be rooted in the supremely beautiful one, God himself. He is the one by whom all beauty must be judged and evaluated. In the case of music, then, we can say that good and beautiful music honours and glorifies God by conforming to the standards of beauty he has woven into the fabric of creation.

As with all of creation, though, music too has been affected by the incursion of sin into the world. This accounts for the glut of bad music we are all too familiar with. But Christ's redemption extends to all of creation, and thus includes the redemption of music. He reigns as Lord over all things, including music, and as witnesses to the risen and ascended King, we bear the responsibility of witnessing to this redemption of music.

Again, to define what this actually looks like is exceedingly difficult. Does it mean, as it has for many Christians, that we simply baptise existing forms of music by infusing them with Christian lyrics? Anyone familiar with the [CCM movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Christian_music) or with many modern worship songs will know that this has resulted, in many instances, in the production of a great deal of bad music.

We must acknowledge, then, that the call placed upon us goes much farther. Christian musicians are called to produce music which strives not only to honour and glorify God through its lyrical content, but which also conforms to the creational norms of beauty. The degree to which a Christian will be successful in doing so, of course, is in many ways tempered by the sinfulness that remains in their hearts. But as the Spirit works within their hearts to sanctify them, and as they pursue righteousness, all that they do, including writing music, will more and more be brought into conformity with God's will.

Allow me to stress again that this is not in any way a black and white issue, and I do not intend to make any definitive statements on the matter. There are many more facets of this issue to consider. For instance, we should note that, owing to God's common grace at work in the world, those who do not worship and serve him are nevertheless capable of producing good and beautiful music. This is not in any way a simple topic, and it is worthy of a much more extensive conversation.

My point is that, contrary to Warren, I do think there is indeed something we can legitimately call 'Christian music'. And it is part of our calling as subjects of our great King to make every effort to determine what that is, and to share it with the world around us, blessing the world with something truly good and beautiful. And as we do so, we make known the One who created all that is, including the 'stuff' with which we can make music, and who enables us to enjoy, appreciate, and be moved by beauty.
