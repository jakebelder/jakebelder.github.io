<p><a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ebusch/welcome-e.htm">Eberhard Busch</a>, from his recently translated work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drawn-Freedom-Christian-Conversation-Heidelberg/dp/0802863787/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1281794834&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Drawn to Freedom: Christian Faith Today in Conversation with the Heidelberg Catechism</em></a>, on the fellowship of believers in the church:</p>
<blockquote>
One can foster religious convictions on one's own, but we have Christian faith only in the fellowship of the church. Private Christianity is wooden iron. A church that is like a restaurant, where all kinds of customers sit at individual tables and are served by waiters who rush here and there attempting to meet their wishes, is wooden iron too. If any comfort consists in the fact that I do not '<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_intro.cfm#QandA1">belong to myself</a>,' then there is no comfort for me without having my circling around myself taken away from me. Where the church is, there a redemption comes into view that redeems me not simply as an individual, but redeems me also from my individualism. So to be a Christian means to be in the church.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_spirit.cfm#QandA%2055">Article 55</a> expounds this. It says rightly first off that all Christians together and each individually &ndash; as members of Christ &ndash; 'share in one fellowship with Christ' and in his gifts. For the Head of the community is not only the key to what the community is. He is also the reason that Christian life is life in fellowship. Jesus Christ is Immanuel, God's <em>guarantee</em> to be God in fellowship with us humans. As such, Jesus Christ is also the fulfillment of the double command of love, in which the vertical and the horizontal, the God-human relationships and the human-human relationship are insolubly linked. If the Holy Spirit brings us into relationship with this God who in Christ keeps fellowship with us, then faith means: 'fellowship with Christ.' If we come into fellowship with him, we come into fellowship with all with whom he keeps fellowship. None of us can be a child of God in the Holy Spirit without being together with other children of God who now may and should discover one another as sisters and brothers. That '<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_spirit.cfm#QandA%2054">the Son of God...gathers, protects, and preserves</a>' the church does not take away the responsibility of those who experiences this, or make them passive. This action calls them forth and calls them out to answer in word and deed and to confess themselves part of the church gathered and supported by him. They do this because they no longer belong to themselves, but to their faithful Savior (225-226).
