Most of the first book of [Irenaeus’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) magnum opus, *[Against Heresies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Detection_and_Overthrow_of_the_So-Called_Gnosis)*, is devoted to exposing the teachings of various heretical sects, largely connected with [Gnosticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism). As you read through Irenaeus’ account of the multitude of Aeons, words that reveal secret codes and hidden knowledge because of the numerical value of their different letters, and so on, it makes almost no sense; indeed, [Alexander Roberts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Roberts), the translator, notes in the introduction that 'not a little of what is contained in the following pages will seem almost unintelligible to the English reader'. In part, that is Irenaeus’ point – to demonstrate the absurdity of these heresies. He even pauses halfway through, in I.xvi.3, to remark to his readers,

<blockquote>
I well know, my dear friend, that when thou hast read through all of this, thou wilt indulge in a hearty laugh over this their inflated wise folly!
</blockquote>

And that is certainly the temptation when also face we encounter something that seems so ridiculous. In some ways, it has even become acceptable to do so (or at least is done so more regularly in public) in the social media age. But Irenaeus demonstrates that he also has a deeply pastoral heart, and will not allow his readers to keep laughing at those who hold these false teachings:

<blockquote>
But those men are really worthy of being mourned over, who promulgate such a kind of religion, and who so frigidly and perversely pull to pieces the greatness of the truly unspeakable power, and the dispensations of God.
</blockquote>

Would that we did the same. Of all the things the Bible says about dealing with false teachers, it never instructs us to laugh at them. Instead, our actions towards them must always be guided by the goal of bringing them to repentance.
