<p>John Stott once said, "One of the major reasons people reject the Gospel today is not because they perceive it to be false but because they perceive it to be trivial." Because of that, he founded the <a href="http://www.licc.org.uk/">London Institute for Contemporary Christianity</a> in 1982 to be a resource to help Christians grow in their understanding of what it means for Christ to be Lord over all. The mission of LICC, according to their website, is "to envision and equip Christians and their churches for whole-life  missionary discipleship in the world. We seek to serve them with  biblical frameworks, practical resources, training and models so that  they flourish as followers of Jesus and grow as whole-life  disciplemaking communities."</p>
<p>Here is Mark Greene, the institute's director, talking a bit more about their mission:</p>

<p>This is very encouraging. It's always exciting when Christians really understand that Christ's Lordship extends over all of life.</p>
