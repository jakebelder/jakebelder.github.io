[Haddon Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Robinson), in his book, *[Biblical Preaching](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801049121/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0801049121&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, makes the following observation, which, while specifically addressing preachers, is something that all Christians need to deal with:

<blockquote>
In approaching a passage [of Scripture], we must be willing to re-examine our doctrinal convictions and to reject the judgements of our most respected teachers. We must make a U-turn in our own previous understandings of the Bible should these conflict with the concepts of the biblical writer (22).
</blockquote>

And this is perhaps one of the most difficult things Christians must do.
