<p>Any true Christian knows that Christ is the centre of all of history, but sometimes it is good to be reminded of this truth. Adrio K&ouml;nig, a South African theologian, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802803563/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0802803563" target="_blank"><em>The Eclipse of Christ in Eschatology</em></a>, notes how Christ ties together creation and consummation:</p>
<blockquote>
The most profound link between creation and consummation lies in Jesus Christ himself, who is the beginning and the end, the first and the last, the Creator and the Consummator. In his own person he unites creation and consummation. In him they are not two events infinitely separated from each other in time, but a single reality bound together in him, the living Lord, by whose power creation proceeds to consummation and consummation comes forth from creation. All is created by him, and by him all is renewed.
</blockquote>

From the start, the one by whom all things were created would be the one who consummates that creation and ushers in the Kingdom of God in fulness. The story of history is the story of Christ unfolding the plan for creation. Christ, therefore, is the ultimate key to the meaning of all of reality.
