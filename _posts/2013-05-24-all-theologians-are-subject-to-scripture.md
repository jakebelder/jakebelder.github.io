One of the books I have been reading recently is [Oliver O'Donovan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_O%27Donovan) book, *[On the Thirty-Nine Articles: Conversations with Tudor Christianity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HITR40/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B005HITR40&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, which is a bit of a commentary on the doctrinal foundation of Anglicanism, and something of an exploration of what the authors of the Articles were attempting to convey in their formulations. I have just finished working through the chapter that deals with Article VIII, which says this:

<blockquote>
The Three Creeds, <em>Nicene</em> Creed, <em>Athanasius's</em> Creed, and that which is commonly called the <em>Apostles'</em>  Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy Scripture.
</blockquote>

O'Donovan makes a helpful observation about the last phrase of the article, noting that the authors of the Articles never intended that we simply take their word that the contents of the Creeds (and really, the conclusions of all the church's theology throughout history) are faithful to Scripture, but that we ourselves do the work of looking at Scripture with them to determine their faithfulness to the revealed Word of God. He writes,

<blockquote>
The adequacy of what the theologians have said will be measured by the Scriptures. If we would judge this adequacy, we must read through the Scriptures with them, pose the questions they posed in the light of them, weigh the answers they gave. And if we find their work good, we may confidently adopt their conclusions and their conceptualizations, making them our own, yet all the time knowing that they are still answerable to Scripture. The map may be excellent â€“ possibly even faultless. Yet precisely because it <em>is</em> a map, it is answerable to the countryside, not the countryside to it. The experienced walker does not assume too quickly that the map is in error; yet the question of its adequacy can never be settled absolutely, once and for all. And so it is with our guides for theological exploration. They are our seniors, much to be respected and never to be scorned; we will always, if we are wise, assume that we have much to learn from them. Yet we learn from them best when we hear them critically, testing and proving the value of their work against the measure which judge all theologians equally and without respect of persons (52).
</blockquote>

These are good words, and for those of us who may come from traditions where creeds and confessions were sometimes given *de facto* authority over Scripture, this is a good reminder of [what healthy confessionalism looks like](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/sola-scriptura-and-healthy-confessionalism). Every theologian and every theological statement is *always* and *only* answerable to the full and final authority of Scripture, and we grow most in our knowledge and love for God when we understand that.
