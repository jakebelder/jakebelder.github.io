For much of the church's history prior to the Reformation, the common perception was that if you served God as a priest or as a monk or some other such calling, you were more holy and godly than those who lived ordinary lives. This perception changed significantly during the Reformation, however, as the Reformers began to teach that godliness was not measured by your vocation, but instead by whether or not you devoted the whole of your life God and sought to live faithfully under the rule of Christ.

[Hugh Latimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Latimer), one of the early Anglican Reformers, makes this point as he tells of a story he once heard, which is recorded in a book I've been reading recently, *[Love's Redeeming Work: The Anglican Quest for Holiness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0191070580/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0191070580&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. He wanted to illustrate the point that a simple [cobbler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoemaking) could be just as godly as an [ascetic monk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism):

<blockquote>
I read once a story of a holy man (some say it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great">St Anthony</a>), which had been a long season in the wilderness, neither eating nor drinking anything but bread and water: at length he thought himself so holy, that there should be nobody like unto him. Therefore he desired of God to known who should be his fellow in heaven. God made him answer, and commanded him to go to Alexandria; there he should find a cobler which should be his fellow in heaven. Now he went thither and sought him out, and fell into acquaintance with him, and tarried with him three or four days to see his conversation. In the morning his wife and he prayed together; then they went to their business, he in his shop, and she about her housewifery. At dinner time they had bread and cheese, wherewith they were well content, and took it thankfully. Their children were well taught to fear God, and to say their <em>Pater-noster</em>, and the Creed, and the Ten Commandments; and so he spent his time in doing his duty truly. I warrant you, he did not so many false stitches as coblers do now-a-days. St Anthony perceiving that, came to knowledge of himself, and laid away all pride and presumption. By this ensample you may learn, that honest conversation and godly living is much regarded before God; insomuch as this poor cobler, doing his duty diligently, was made St Anthony's fellow. So it appeareth that we be not destituted of religious houses: those which apply their business uprightly and hear God's word, they shall be St Anthony's fellows; that is to say, they shall be numbered amongst the children of God.
</blockquote>

Of course, the idea that those who serve in certain vocations are more holy or godly than others still persists today. But Latimer is exactly right â€“ what matters is living faithfully in whatever walk of life you are called to. Christ does not claim Lordship only over the lives of ministers and missionaries and monks, but over *everyone*. So figure out what it looks like to live *your* life faithfully and what it looks like for *you* to be godly, and do that.
