<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted here at the end of the week. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of November together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>November 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21565143-can-museum-christianity-succeed-britain-divine-detour" target="_blank"><strong>Divine detour: Can a museum of Christianity succeed in Britain?</strong></a> - There are plans to turn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Castle" target="_blank">Auckland Castle</a> in County Durham into a museum on the history of Christianity in Britain. This could be quite interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/chosen-for-what/11/" target="_blank"><strong>Chosen for What?</strong></a> - The always thought-provoking <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood</a> has a brief but interesting post on the purpose of God's electing of his people.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/cutting-edge-of-marketplace-ministries.html?paging=off&amp;buffer_share=46210&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>The Cutting Edge of Marketplace Ministries</strong></a> - An article appeared on the <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> blog this week about a fantastic initiative in Cincinnati, Ohio, aimed at helping businesses integrate faith and work. It sounds excellent, and when businesses look to do this sort of holistic ministry, it is an incredible way to bless your city. Read the article and be challenged and encouraged by the possibilities of this sort of ministry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.100abandonedhouses.com/" target="_blank"><strong>100 Abandoned Houses</strong></a> - I've always been drawn to images of abandoned buildings and decay, and so I was very intrigued by these photos of abandoned homes in Detroit.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/whats-so-great-about-common-good.html?paging=off&amp;buffer_share=2dde6&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>What's So Great About 'The Common Good'?</strong></a> - Here is a very interesting article by <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc" target="_blank">Andy Crouch</a> on what the idea of the 'common good' is all about, and why it is a concept that we should hold on to as we think about working in our cities and societies.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qideas.org/video/principle-pluralism.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Principled Pluralism</strong></a> - Over on the Q Ideas blog this week, there was a short video posted in which <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss" target="_blank">Gideon Strauss</a> talks about how Christians can seek the flourishing of all people in society. There's a lot of great stuff packed into these eight minutes; much to chew on and think about.</li>
<li><a href="http://davidould.net/?p=5080&amp;buffer_share=d6a92&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Habemus Cantuara? &ndash; The New ArchBishop of Canterbury</strong></a> - As you would expect, there was lots of reaction in the blogosphere this week to the announcement of Justin Welby's appointment as the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury. <a href="http://twitter.com/davidould" target="_blank">David Ould</a> chips in with some good thoughts over on his blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/a-message-to-archbishop-welby-be-urgent.html" target="_blank"><strong>A message to Archbishop Welby: "be urgent"</strong></a> -&nbsp; And <a href="http://twitter.com/ugleyvicar" target="_blank">John Richardson</a> has a few good thoughts as well, particularly challenging Welby to be urgent in proclaiming the gospel.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.john-stevens.com/2012/11/responding-to-jake-belder-84-of-fiec.html" target="_blank"><strong>84% of FIEC Churches Allow Paedo-Baptists into Membership</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/_JohnStevens" target="_blank">John Stevens</a> replies to my post from earlier this week <a href="http://jakebelder.com/bring-baptists-and-paedo-baptists-together-66975" target="_blank">on the question of unity between baptists and paedo-baptists</a> with some helpful thoughts and clarifications on the nature of the FIEC. I appreciate his willingness to carry on what is, I think, an important conversation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/jacobs/a-real-bishop/" target="_blank"><strong>A Real Bishop</strong></a> - My observation has been that in general, people have a rather low opinion of the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. <a href="http://twitter.com/ayjay" target="_blank">Alan Jacobs</a>, however, in this interesting post, argues that he set precisely the example Anglicans desperately needed, even if most of them have rejected that example.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.anthonysmith.me.uk/2012/11/13/why-is-a-church-service-called-a-service/" target="_blank"><strong>Why is a church service called a &ldquo;service&rdquo;?</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith" target="_blank">Anthony Smith</a> tweeted this question earlier this week and it developed into a blog post with some interesting reflections and conclusions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/11/reading_on_a_kindle_is_not_the_same_as_reading_a_book.single.html" target="_blank"><strong>Reading on a Kindle is not the same as reading a book</strong></a> - Yes, I'm <em>that</em> guy who still thinks it's better to read a print copy of a book. Reading a book is <a href="http://jakebelder.com/on-kindles-and-things-tangible" target="_blank">an involved experience</a> that just can't be replicated with an e-book.</li>
<li><a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/what-is-evangelicalism-part-2/" target="_blank"><strong>What is Evangelicalism? &ndash; Part 2</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts</a> continues his very helpful discussion on the definition of evangelicalism in this post, responding to a couple of others posts and beginning to answer the question of evangelicalism's definitions and identifications. Do be sure to read it (<a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/what-is-evangelicalism-part-1/" target="_blank">part 1 is here</a>) and look for part 3 and 4 next week.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20243493" target="_blank">Jos&eacute; Mujica: The world's 'poorest' president</a></strong> - I'm not sure you would find many presidents giving away 90% of their income and living in a rundown farm outside the city, but Mujica, the president of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" target="_blank">Uruguay</a>, does. This is quite an interesting story.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wts.edu/stayinformed/view.html?id=1409" target="_blank"><strong>Kingdom, Covenant, Mediator</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/drantbradley" target="_blank">Anthony Bradley</a>, professor of theology and ethics at <a href="http://www.tkc.edu/" target="_blank">The King's College</a> in New York, gave a great lecture at <a href="http://www.wts.edu/" target="_blank">Westminster Theological Seminary</a> a couple of weeks ago on the importance of recovering the themes of kingdom, covenant, and mediator in our theological discourse. He makes some significant points, which are great springboards for further conversation. The linked page also has a couple of videos where he talks about the church, race, and culture.</li>
<li><a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/what-is-evangelicalism-part-3/" target="_blank"><strong>What is Evangelicalism? &ndash; Part 3</strong></a> - In this post, <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts</a> continues his thorough and helpful analysis of evangelicalism. <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/what-is-evangelicalism-part-4/" target="_blank"><strong>And then in part 4</strong></a>, to wrap up the series, he asks, 'Where do we go from here?' Take the time to read these posts. There is much to think about.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2009/may/27/china-calvin-christianity" target="_blank"><strong>Chinese Calvinism flourishes</strong></a> - Though it was published a few years ago, for some reason this article from <em>The Guardian</em> on the growth of Calvinism in Chinese Christianity went around the web this week. There are a few odd and uninformed remarks, but otherwise this is a fascinating article. It's very interesting to think about what this will look like as it unfolds in the coming decades.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/church-of-england-remains-bit-more.html" target="_blank"><strong>Church of England remains a bit more Catholic</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Archbishop Cranmer</a>, always thoughtful, provides an interesting analysis of this week's vote in the Church of England's General Synod against a measure that would have permitted the ordination of women as bishops.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/page.cfm?ID=759&amp;buffer_share=745a7&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Women Bishops: It&rsquo;s about the Bible, not fake ideas of progress</strong></a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/profntwright" target="_blank">N.T. Wright</a> responded to the issue of women bishops with a piece in <em>The Times</em>, which was cross-posted on the <a href="http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/index.cfm" target="_blank">Fulcrum</a> blog. He makes one very good point, that the life of the church must be shaped by the Bible, but the rest of the article is somewhat lacking in substance.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/mr-speaker-guides-labour-mps-on-church.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mr Speaker 'guides' Labour MPs on Church of England equality</strong></a> - Parliament has responded to the Synod vote this week as well, saying it will do all it can to get women ordained as bishops immediately. <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Cranmer</a> is spot on: 'Forget the need to find a solution that might be acceptable to everyone:  this is now the raw politics of power. His Grace never thought he would  say this, but disestablishment is a far more attractive option than  this discredited, dysfunctional and deficient parliament imposing its  secular will upon the religious conscience of the Church of England.'</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/questions-i-have-about-galatians-328/" target="_blank"><strong>Questions I have about Galatians 3:28</strong></a> - This passage is coming up in many conversations following on from the vote against women bishops in the Church of England a couple of weeks ago. <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor" target="_blank">Phil Whittall</a> goes to work trying to get his head around the context and the questions the verse raises.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J1ICrK36RI" target="_blank"><strong>How <em>Car and Driver</em> tests cars</strong></a> - If you're a petrolhead, this is really interesting stuff. <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com" target="_blank"><em>Car and Driver</em></a> is an American car magazine, and in this video they take a Mercedes SLK55 AMG and show you how they test all their cars. I want this job.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/33299439" target="_blank"><strong>Byron Borger on being a Christian bookseller</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/byronborger" target="_blank">Byron Borger</a> and his wife run <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/" target="_blank">Hearts and Minds Books</a> in Dallastown, Pennsylvania, and at a conference hosted by the <a href="http://www.faithandwork.org/" target="_blank">Redeemer Center for Faith and Work</a> last year, he gave a short presentation on what their bookstore was all about. Would that there were more booksellers Byron in the world! We need more Christians who are truly devoted to whole-life discipleship.</li>
<li><a href="http://freelanceanglican.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/ten-reasons-to-be-anglican.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ten Reasons to be Anglican</strong></a> -&nbsp; Some Anglicans, when asked why they remain in the Church of England, reply that it is the 'best boat to fish from'. But here is a guy who has put together an Interesting and thoughtful list of reasons as to why he is an Anglican.</li>
<li><a href="http://bookdedications.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>bookdedications</strong></a> - The curator of this blog buys second-hand books and then blogs the various inscriptions he finds on the inside cover. This is a great idea, and there are some really interesting stories that are begging to be told when you read some of the personal notes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/11/the-case-for-drinking-as-much-coffee-as-you-like/265693/" target="_blank"><strong>The Case for Drinking as Much Coffee as You Like</strong></a> - Why is everybody in the world not drinking coffee? The author notes, '[A] study published in May in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> looked at hundreds of thousands of men and     women and found this bottom line <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1112010?query=featured_home&amp;&amp;">result</a>: people who drank     coffee lived longer than those who didn't.' God blesses those who enjoy the good things of his creation.</li>
