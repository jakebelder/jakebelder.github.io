I’ve been reading through Reggie Kidd’s book, With One Voice: Discovering Christ's Song In Our Worship, for Reggie Kidd’s class here in seminary. There’s a lot of great stuff in this book, and I do recommend it (and I don’t say that only because I’m being graded by him). All kidding aside, though, there’s a lot of wisdom in what he’s written, and I think a lot the church can glean from it. I want to quote at length here and then interact a little. Forgive the length of this post, but please read through it, I think it is helpful stuff. Reggie says:

<blockquote>
It is the church…where the most honest music has thrived…Here in the church are frank and honest songs. The folk songs of the church create a climate of comfort and familiarity in which we can be real with one another about why we need a Savior.<br><br>

The folk songs of the church also give shape to different truths and moods of the faith itself. Whatever stream of Christianity any of us has landed in---high or low Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox---we have received a heritage of song. Christian philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff says we all have our ‘tribal’ music. There’s incredible richness in the Christian family tree, and each branch seems to have been entrusted with a special insight and a unique voice.<br><br>

Our spiritual forbears sensed a particular ‘fit’ between their preaching of the faith and their singing of the faith. Lutheran chorales and hymns have their own way of interweaving the objectivity of Christ’s work for us with the subjective benefits of his life in us. Methodist and Moravian hymns have theirs. Genevan metrical psalms embody both the gravitas (the weightiness) of what it is to worship a holy God, and the delight of having this holy God draw near in grace. Baptist testimony songs give voice to the Christian instinct for telling our neighbors the Good News, while Baptist hymns make their own contribution to Christendom’s majestic praise. Anglo-Catholic settings of ‘service music’ adorn worship that is a weekly recapitulation of the history of redemption. Orthodox chanting makes palpable the mystery of the interconnectedness between heaven and earth. The grittiness of spirituals (both African American and shape-note) preserve the cross-shaped hopefulness of life lived out in pilgrimage. We’re all trustees of a profound gift.<br><br>

Many communions, in fact, are learning musically what theologian Robert Webber has taught: ours is an ancient-future faith, and so, in many respects, the way forward takes us through the past. Respectful attention to heritage is a bridge to the future (154-155).

I really like what Reggie says here, though I think you can take two perspectives on the implications of this. First, he notes that each tradition has its own musical heritage, and each has been developed according to its theological perspective, and in some cases I would argue its historical context. As each tradition is the guardian of an heritage, should each tradition stick to its heritage, and continue to worship in that way?

Or second, should traditions interact with each other with their worship, and be willing to share and borrow elements of worship from each other and blend them together into a rich diversity of styles? I’ve had experience in both sorts of scenarios. In the time I spent in very conservative Reformed churches, the preservation of the worship that is rooted in their heritage is very important. But I’ve also worshiped in settings where a wide variety of worship styles were blended together in a wonderfully eclectic mix. Further on, I think Reggie gives an answer to the question, or at least points us in a certain direction. I resonate with what he says:

<blockquote>
The history of the church has produced a host of ways communities can embody and sing the faith…Each of us finds ourselves in a community that has come from somewhere and that does things certain ways for certain reasons…As each group develops its nuances, it becomes a family and develops its own folk culture. That’s necessary, and it’s good. But we say something profound about the gospel itself when we stay a family and refuse to allow ourselves to become insular, a closed-in group. By God’s grace, we can nurture the good we’ve inherited from our family tree, further its contribution to the larger body of Christ, and at the same time appreciate---and perhaps learn from---folks who sing Christ’s song differently.<br><br>

…One of the greatest challenges of our day is to live with what sociologist Peter Berger calls ‘the heretical imperative,’ that is, an awareness that our tribe’s way of embodying the faith is not the only option. As we become more aware of each other’s song we see more clearly that our own way of singing is a choice. It’s not the only option. None of us embodies wholly the wholeness of who our Savior is. In that realization we avoid the pitfalls of what we might call xenophobic ‘tribalism’---the belief that the gospel stands or falls with the particular way in which our tribe sings it (156-157).
</blockquote>

The church is a global community of believers. It is not one particular group in one particular place at one particular time. I don't think anyone can rightly claim a monopoly on how to worship. There is no one way, and that is the beauty about the family of God. All the different styles that Reggie mentioned above, and all of those which he didn’t, combine together to blend into one voice, the voice of Christ singing through us. And it’s a *beautiful* sound.
