<p>Well, sort of. I am going to resume posting on this blog, but only in a limited way at this point.</p>
<p>Currently, I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share links to articles and posts worth reading, and usually cross-post them to Facebook as well. However, in a continued effort to minimize my use of the latter as much as possible, I am going to stop posting the links there, and instead collate them in a blog post each Monday. That post will then be shared on Facebook, providing all the links in one place of instead of being scattered all over my timeline. Additionally, this will make it much easier for me to locate things I've posted in the past should I need to find a link again in the future.</p>
<p><span class="st">The idea is for this to be a collection of interesting  or stimulating things that you can read or scan over a cup of coffee on Monday  morning. </span>I'm calling this <strong><em>M<span class="st">iscellan&eacute;es</span></em></strong><span class="st">, which is simply the French word for "miscellanies," only because that is exactly what the posts are &ndash; a collection of miscellaneous things &ndash; and because I felt like using a French word that was easily decipherable to non-French speakers. Beyond that, it has no significance. <br /></span></p>
<p><span class="st">Other posting will remain on hold, likely until summer.<br /></span></p>

The new "series" begins next Monday, 9 April 2012.
