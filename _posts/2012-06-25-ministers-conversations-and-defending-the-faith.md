<p>As with any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" target="_blank">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, some people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Williams" target="_blank">Rowan Williams</a>, and some don't. I find myself in the more conservative evangelical camp of the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org" target="_blank">Church of England</a>, and it would not be inaccurate to say that most in this camp do not feel he is a particularly good Archbishop. Since I have only been a part of the English church scene for about a year, I do not have much to contribute to that conversation.</p>
<p>Williams does not share all the same theological convictions that I do, but like with anyone else whose perspective is different than mine, I always make a conscious effort to be generous and charitable and to try and see what I can learn from them. When he says things like this, however, it makes it a little harder to do that.</p>

<p>I am not sure when or where Rowan Williams said this, or what context he said it in, but I doubt that even knowing the context would make this statement any less unbiblical or ambiguous. A few thoughts in response, then.</p>
<p>First, like Williams, I would probably not call ministers 'defenders of the faith' (simply because within the Church of England, that title is given to the Queen). Aside from this, though, it seems that Williams is denying the role ministers have in protecting the faith. That the Archbishop of Canterbury would take such a stand is troubling, especially considering it directly contradicts what Paul writes to Timothy in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206:20&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">1 Timothy 6:20</a>, when he tells the young minister to 'guard what has been entrusted to your care.' This theme of leaders in the church protecting and preserving the gospel and doctrine of the church is repeated many times in Scripture, especially in the epistles of the New Testament. As one familiar with the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Book of Common Prayer</em></a>, Williams would also know that at their ordination, Church of England ministers are asked, 'Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's Word?' Their assent to that question is a commitment to protect the faith.</p>

<p>Second, the idea of being hospitable and 'facilitating a conversation' is entirely ambiguous. Who are the parties engaged in this 'conversation'? Is it a conversation between leaders who hold significantly different theological perspectives or even leaders of other faiths? While these conversations have their place, they are certainly not more important than protecting the faith of the church.</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps Williams is talking about ministers facilitating conversations between parishioners who are wrestling with big questions of faith and life and seeking deeper understanding, or between those who do not yet know Christ and might be exploring faith. In this case, facilitating a conversation is of great importance. But in this role especially the minister must explain and proclaim the truth of the faith they are charged with protecting. Participants in this conversation are invited to explore, to be sure, but to explore the truth as revealed in God's Word, which the minister guides them to see. 'Facilitating a conversation' and protecting the faith are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are entirely complementary.</p>
<p>In the church, being hospitable is about welcoming everyone to explore the truth found in Jesus Christ, and to discover the fulness of life lived in submission to him. Creating an environment that welcomes conversations and discussions is good, but in the context of the church, this can only properly be done when ministers and leaders in the church are committed to protecting the faith. There <em>is </em>something to guard and defend, and like we learn about the church in Ephesus in 1 Timothy, failing to do that results in disastrous consequences.</p>

If you are a minister and want to facilitate a conversation, by all means do so. But do so only by inviting those you converse with to discover 'the sound doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God' (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%201:3-11&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">1 Timothy 1:10-11</a>). Anything less is unwelcoming and inhospitable.
