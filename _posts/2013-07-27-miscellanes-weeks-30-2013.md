Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 266px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/working%20in%20a%20cafe.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>21-27 July 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18yr4gU">Prepare Among the People</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/stevekmccoy">Steve McCoy</a> has a great post on <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager's</a> blog about the benefits of doing your sermon preparation outside of your study, where the people you want to reach hang out.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18A0tQs">Widen Your Dialogue</a></strong> – Another good post on <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager's</a> blog, this time from <a href="http://twitter.com/bobby_griffith">Bobby Griffith</a>, who notes the importance of reading widely and talking to people as you prepare your sermons.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/163v82C">Learning to Love Leviticus</a></strong> – I have not read anything from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._H._Wright">Chris Wright</a> that I haven't enjoyed, and this article is no different. Wright offers a helpful, accessible, and brief guide on how to read the Old Testament, and specifically the Law. For Christians who struggle to make sense of how it all fits together, this is a great place to start.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dRPGyj">High Church</a></strong> – A couple of articles <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/miscellanees-week-29-2013">last week</a> noted the growing trend amongst young Christians to drift toward high church traditions. For anyone who found those interesting, you may also find this response interesting.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://thetim.es/16hUKJg">Seven EU myths you should never believe</a></strong> – Here in the UK, we keep hearing a lot these days about why being a part of the European Union is a bad thing, and indeed, 'Euroscepticism' seems to be growing. According to this article, however, a lot of the scepticism is based on myth.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13KMDGg">Short-term missions trips and cultural institutions</a></strong> – The whole paradigm of short-term missions has been critiqued often in recent times, for various reasons. This article doesn't so much critique the practice as it does the way churches use their money. The author suggests that using the money allocated for short-term missions for other purposes, such as investing in local institutions, would be much more beneficial for the common good.</li>
