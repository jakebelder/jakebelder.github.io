As I’ve mentioned a number of times [in recent posts](http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/james-k-a-smith), one of the central themes of [James K.A. Smith’s](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) ‘[Cultural Liturgies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVs0kW7QWU)’ series of books is that we are shaped not so much by what we think, but by the things we love and desire. Those desires, he argues, are shaped by a set of practices, which work at a deep level to orient our hearts in a particular direction.

In his most recent book in the series, *[Imagining the Kingdom: How Worship Works](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035783&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, he observes that, even though we are formed and shaped in significant ways by liturgies of all kinds, yet many Christians have an aversion to this very thing in worship. Smith writes:

<blockquote>
Protestants have a built-in allergy to repetition in worship, although we are quite happy to affirm the value of repetition in almost every other sphere of life, from study to music to sports to art. We affirm the value of ritual repetition if we’re learning piano scales or learning to hit a golf ball but are curiously suspicious of repetitive ritual in worship and discipleship (181-182).
</blockquote>

Smith suggests that this ‘allergy’ has three causes. The first is a suspicion that any sort of ritual repetition is necessarily bound up with the idea of ‘works righteousness’. Formed prayers, set liturgies, and anything else like this are generally perceived to be signs of spiritual insincerity. The second is that in much of contemporary worship, sincere individual expressions of praise have become the highest good and are held up as the most authentic forms of worship. As a result, a culture has formed in which whatever is new and novel is of greatest value. Third, and in relation to this, the culture of novelty disdains anything ‘old’ and ‘traditional’.

Anyone who has spent any length of time in evangelical churches would recognise much of this analysis to be true. And although Smith acknowledges that this allergy is often borne out of good intentions (he notes, for instance, that the Psalms encourage spontaneous expressions of praise and worship), he urges us not to ignore the reality that our culture is hard at work to impose its own liturgies on us, to shape and form our hearts. It is crucial that we understand Christian worship as a process of formation, shaping us in line with the story of Scripture. If it doesn't, something else will.

<blockquote>
The wisdom of historic Christian worship runs counter to all three of these assumptions precisely because it sees worship not only as expressive (what we offer to God) but also as <em>formative</em> (what God is doing <em>to us</em> in the encounter)… Quite simply, there is no formation without repetition. There is no habituation without being immersed in a practice over and over again. There will be no sanctification of our perception apart from a regular, repeated recentering of our imagination in the Story of the gospel as rehearsed and enacted in the ‘practical logic’ of Christian worship. So it is precisely our allergy to repetition in worship that has undercut the counterformative power of Christian worship – because all kinds of secular liturgies shamelessly affirm the good of repetition. We’ve let the devil, so to speak, have all the repetition. And we, as liturgical animals, are only too happy to find our rhythms in such repetition. Unless Christian worship eschews the cult of novelty and embraces the good of faithful repetition, we will constantly be ceding habituation to secular liturgies (182-183).
</blockquote>

It's time to cast off our aversion to our aversion to repetition in worship. We need the formative power of the liturgies of Christian worship if we are going to be a people shaped and transformed by the gospel, and equipped to stand in faithfulness in the midst of our culture's attempts to impose its own narratives on us.
