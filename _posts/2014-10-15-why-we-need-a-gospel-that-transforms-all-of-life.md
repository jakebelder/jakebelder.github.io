Why do we need a gospel that transforms all of life? Because otherwise our witness in the world is compromised.

<blockquote>
As for me, I will believe in no belief that does not make itself manifest by outward signs. I will think no preaching sincere that is not recommended by the practice of the preacher.<br>

<blockquote>
How can any one remain interested in a religion which seems to have no concern with nine-tenths of his life?<br>

<blockquote>
I am still convinced that one of the major reasons why people reject the Gospel in the West today is not because they perceive it to be false but because they perceive it to be trivial.<br>

<blockquote>
There seems little point in a religion which is merely a weekly social event (apart, of course, from the normal pleasures of a weekly social event), as opposed to one which tells you exactly how to live, which colours and stains everything… What’s the point of faith unless you and it are serious – <em>seriously</em> serious – unless your religion fills, directs, stains and sustains your life? <br>

We are always quick to deny the assertion made by so many in our culture that Christianity is irrelevant. But perhaps they are just keenly observant, and see a Christianity in which our lives don't look all that different from theirs. People notice when the gospel does not transform [the whole of your life](http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/all-of-life), and they will simply write it off. No, if Christ is Lord, [*everything* matters](http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html), and [*everything* must change](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col+3.17&version=NIV).
