<p>I have been reading <a href="http://www.calvinseminary.edu/aboutUs/facultyStaff/bltj.php">John Bolt's</a> book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Reformed-Today-John-Bolt/dp/0888150679/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307624530&amp;sr=8-3">Christian and Reformed Today</a></em> (which is <a href="http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/ChristianAndReformedToday.pdf">available free as a PDF here</a>), and already in the first couple of chapters I have found some particularly important things regarding the trinitarian emphasis in Reformed theology. Bolt argues that, although most Christian traditions certainly claim to be trinitarian, they often focus on one person of the Trinity to the exclusion of the other two. Only in the Reformed tradition, Bolt asserts, can one find a fully trinitarian Christianity.</p>
<p>For the purposes of defintion, Bolt says, "A Reformed person is <em>trinitarian</em> in theology and <em>catholic</em> in vision" (21). Expanding first on the trinitarian aspect of his defintion, Bolt cites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a>, who writes, "The essence of the Christian religion consists therein, that the creation of the Father, destroyed by sin, is again restored in the death and resurrection of the Son of God, and recreated by the grace of the Spirit to a Kingdom of God" (29). It is notable that though all three persons of the Trinity are equal, there is a logical flow that begins with God the Father and creation.</p>
<blockquote>
When Reformed trinitarian theology begins with the Father, this has some important implications. It means specifically that creation has priority over salvation, that salvation is not escape from or elevation above creation but the <em>restoration</em> of creation. It means that the most important question in life is not, "What must I do to be saved," but "How can I glorify God?" As the <a href="http://opc.org/documents/SCLayout.pdf">Westminster Catechism</a> so beautifully states it, "The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." It means that the Reformed tradition places a great deal of emphasis upon the idea of vocation or calling, upon serving God <em>in</em> this world rather than escaping from it (28).
</blockquote>
<p>So we see that a trinitarian theology begins and ends with God as Creator. This means that Christianity which is fully trinitarian will understand the end goal of the Christian life differently than a Christianity which lays more or less stress on one person of the Trinity. Most common in evangelical Christianity is the tendency to elevate the second person of the Trinity, thus making individual salvation the primary focus. As Bolt suggests, when the question, "What must I do to be saved?" becomes fundamental, the Christianity that emerges becomes too narrowly focused and fails to take into account the work of God to restore his creation and establish his rule as King. The biblical narrative is framed by creation and new creation, and our faith and theology must take this into account.</p>
<p>Bolt continues with an explanation of the second part of his definition:</p>
<blockquote>
The second part of the suggested definition has already been hinted at, namely that a Reformed person is <em>catholic</em> in vision. The Reformed view of life in the world is dominated by the idea of God's sovereignty over the entire cosmos. Abraham Kuyper in his <em>Lectures on Calvinism</em> put it this way: The dominating principle of Calvinism 'was not, soteriologically, justification by faith, but in the widest sense cosmologically, <em>the sovereignty of the triune God over the whole cosmos</em>, in all its spheres and kingdoms, visible and invisible.' That is what is meant by catholicity&mdash;the Reformed vision is cosmic or universal. The Reformed person is not satisifed with the salvation of his or her soul, as crucial as that is to being a Christian. The kingdom of heaven, the great Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck was fond of saying, is not only a pearl of great price, the treasure a man finds in a field and must obtain at all costs. It is that indeed, but it is also a leaven and a mustard seed which grows and expands. The gospel is a message for the <em>world</em> as well as for in the individual (29).
</blockquote>
<p>The stream of the Reformed tradition that has come to be known as the New Calvinism has a tendency to hear this and levy accusations both of transformationalism and a neglect of personal piety and holiness. That is a misunderstanding, however, and I think Bolt's emphasis on the trinitarian nature of the Reformed tradition is significant in correcting this misunderstanding. The focus of Reformed theology, as Bavinck notes above, is on the work of the <em>triune God</em> &ndash; not individuals &ndash; in restoring his creation and establishing the Kingdom of God. In turn, the people of God are called to <em>embody</em> the new reality that the coming of the Kingdom of God in Jesus Christ inaugurates. Holiness, then, is living according to the rule of the King in every part of life.</p>

More on this anon.
