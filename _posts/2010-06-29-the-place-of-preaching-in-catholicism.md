<p>I began to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott">John Stott's</a> book on preaching, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Worlds-Challenge-Preaching/dp/0802806279/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1277763571&amp;sr=8-4">Between Two Worlds</a></em>, this morning. He opens with a brief historical sketch examining the place of preaching in the thought and practice of some of the notable church leaders down through history. I was a little surprised to read this about some of the great Catholic figures in the Middle Ages:</p>
<blockquote>
'The Age of Preaching', wrote Charles Smyth, 'dates from the coming of the Friars... The history of the pulpit as we know it begins with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preaching_friars">Preaching Friars</a>. They met, and stimulated, a growing popular demand for sermons. They revolutionzed the technique. They magnified the office.' Although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a> (1182-1226) was a man more of compassionate service than of learning, and insisted that 'our acting and teaching must go together', he was nevertheless 'as committed to preaching as to poverty: "Unless you preach everywhere you go", said Francis, "there is no use to go anywhere to preach." From the very beginning of his ministry, that had been his motto.' His contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Dominic">Dominic</a> (1170-1221) laid even greater emphasis on preaching. Combining personal austerity with evangelistic zeal, he traveled widely in the cause of the gospel, especially in Italy, France and Spain, and organized his 'black friars' into an Order of Preachers. A century later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humbert_de_romans">Humbert de Romans</a> (died 1277), one of the finest of Dominican Ministers General, said: 'Christ only once heard Mass...but he laid great stress on preaching.' And a century later still, the great Franciscan preacher <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02505b.htm">St Bernardino of Siena</a>* (1380-1444) made this unexpected statement: 'If of these two things you can do only one &ndash; either hear the mass or hear the sermon &ndash; you should let the mass go, rather than the sermon... There is less peril for your soul in not hearing mass than in not hearing the sermon' (21-22).
</blockquote>
<p>Recognizing, of course, that it is a much more recently composed document, it is nonetheless interesting to note that the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/ccc_toc.htm">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> seems to exalt the Mass over preaching, in contrast to what the Medieval leaders taught: "The Eucharist is 'the source and summit of the  Christian life.' The other sacraments, and indeed all  ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with  the Eucharist and are oriented toward it" (par. 1324).</p>
<p>However, despite the declaration on the primacy of the Mass, when you turn to the section of the Catechism that speaks about Scripture, it appears that it is to be viewed on the same level: "For this reason, the Church has always venerated the  Scriptures as she venerates the Lord's Body. She never ceases to present  to the faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of God's  Word and Christ's Body" (par. 103), and, "'The Church has always venerated the divine  Scriptures as she venerated the Body of the Lord': both nourish  and govern the whole Christian life" (par. 141).</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that Scripture in and of itself, or perhaps as interpreted and contained in the tradition of the Church is on equal footing with the Mass? Does the nourishment that comes from Scripture come through the <em>preaching</em> of Scripture, or in some other way? Or is the Catechism simply saying that the two are equally important?</p>
<p>Given my limited knowledge of Catholicism I may be missing something simple and obvious on this matter. Therefore, please discuss below.</p>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">*On a side note: the story of Bernardino's missionary work on the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bernardino_of_Siena#Missionary_work">ever-authoritative Wikipedia page</a> is quite interesting. He seemed to have been  something of a medieval <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield">Whitefield</a>.</span>
