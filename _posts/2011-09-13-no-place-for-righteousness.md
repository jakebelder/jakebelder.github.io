<p>Matthew Mason, one of the regular contributors to the blog of the <a href="http://www.saet-online.org/">The Society for the Advancement of Ecclesial Theology</a>, wrote in <a href="http://www.saet-online.org/keeping-the-law-to-please-god/08/">a post some time ago</a>&nbsp;of the growing trend in evangelical circles to speak of 'repenting of our righteousness'. Mason points out that proponents of this perspective argue 'that the gospel is the beginning and end of of the Christian life, that all our problems come from a lack of orientation to the gospel...[and] that Christians should speak like this of our present attempts to obey God.'</p>

<p>The basic point they wish to make is sound &ndash; your understanding of salvation must be rooted in the gospel, along with the recognition that you can do nothing of your own to earn or merit salvation. Agreed. But the argument then extends further to include the idea that you grow as a Christian by increasing your belief in the gospel, or trusting more in the gospel, and so on. Well, to a degree, that is also true. This is emphasized so strongly, however, that any discussion of good works leads to a warning to be careful you're not trusting in your works for salvation.</p>
<p>So what is the place of righteousness, then? And what of the Bible's call to pursue righteousness and holiness? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a>, in the second chapter on faith in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0006280544/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0006280544">Mere Christianity</a></em>, writes,</p>
<blockquote>
The sense in which a Christian leaves it to God is that he puts all his trust in Christ: trusts that Christ will somehow share with him the perfect human obedience which He carried out from His birth to His crucifixion: that Christ will make the man more like Himself and, in a sense, make good his deficiencies. In Christian language, He will share His 'sonship' with us, will make us, like Himself, 'Sons of God'... In a sense, the whole Christian life consists in accepting that very remarkable offer. But the difficulty is to reach the point of recognising that all we have done and can do is nothing... And, in yet another sense, handing everything over to Christ does not, of course, mean that you stop trying. To trust Him means, of course, trying to do all that He says... If you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already.
</blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to earn your righteousness in salvation is to be avoided, certainly. But it is hard to understand how you grow as a disciple of Christ if you are not pursuing righteousness in response to the good news of the gospel.&nbsp;Our homegroups at church have just begun a series on <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Ro12">Romans 12-16</a>. It is particularly noteworthy that after discussing the gospel message in the first eleven chapters, Paul then goes on to lay out some pretty in-depth applications of that gospel and how it should shape our lives as Christians. Those last chapters of Romans show us that you must indeed make the gospel the centre of your life as a Christian, but that you do so by actively pursuing righteousness. And it is not just here in Romans; the Bible speaks repeatedly of the call to live righteous lives. Think of the Psalms, or the book of James.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_main.cfm">Heidelberg Catechism</a> says two important things about this. First, in <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_gratitude.cfm#QandA 86">Q&amp;A 86</a>, it asks why we must still do good when we have been delivered from our misery by God's grace. The response:</p>
<blockquote>
We do good because Christ by his Spirit is renewing us to be like himself, so that in all our living we may show that we are thankful to God for all he has done for us, and so that he may be praised through us. And we do good so that we may be assured of our faith by its fruits, and so that by our godly living our neighbours may be won over to Christ.
</blockquote>
<p>It is striking here to note that God is praised through our righteous living. Those who call us to 'repent of our righteousness' would likely find these words hard to stomach. But perhaps it is even more striking, then, that assurance of our faith is linked with the practice of righteousness. And secondly, the Catechism indicates that genuine repentence and conversion has two parts: the dying-away of the old self, and the coming-to-life of the new. In describing the coming-to-life of the new, the Catechism tells us that this is marked by 'wholehearted joy in God through Christ and a delight to do every kind of good as God wants us to' (<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_gratitude.cfm#QandA 90">Q&amp;A 90</a>).</p>
<p>Belief in the gospel motivates you to act in accordance with it. That action is not an attempt to justify yourself, but an expression of your gratitude for God's grace and your acknowledgement of his rule as Lord and King of heaven and earth.&nbsp;You don't repent of your righteousness, because God calls us to righteousness.</p>

Belief in the gospel and the pursuit of righteousness are not contradictory. To be sure, the latter does not precede the former. But the latter must flow out of the former.
