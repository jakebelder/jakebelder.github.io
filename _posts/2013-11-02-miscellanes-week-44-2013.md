Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 267px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Crossroads.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>27 October-02 November 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iogo3E">Nairobi Communique and Commitment</a></strong> – Here is the final statement produced by the <a href="http://www.gafcon.org">Global Anglican Future Conference</a> after their conference last week in Nairobi. This is so important for the future of the Anglican Church.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iogOqI">Understanding the GAFCON Communiqué – Consultation, Critique and Clarity</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DavidOuld">David Ould</a>, an Australian Anglican who was at GAFCON, has a helpful post here comparing the initial draft statement and the final statement produced at the conference. There are some interesting and notable changes in the final document.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/HpdCAa">Ask an Anglican: The Book of Mormon</a></strong> – There are, of course, lots of resources out there pointing out the differences between Mormonism and Christianity, but I found this short post is quite helpful.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aDGdvL">The Path After Pilling</a></strong> – An absolutely fantastic post here by <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould</a> on what he calls the 'defining point of Biblical fidelity' today. As it seems more and more likely that at some point in the not-too-distant future, the Church of England will move towards some sort of formal recognition of same-sex relationships, Peter teases out the implications of such a move for faithful Anglicans in the UK and discusses how we might respond.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/HumCDa">Why Accept the Authority of the Bible? A Twelve Step Argument</a></strong> – Quite an interesting and helpful post here from <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a> on the basis for the authority of the Bible. This could be helpful to use when engaging in such a conversation with someone who is not a Christian.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aYXFYp">Gavin Ashenden on the Church and Culture</a></strong> – Also from <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld">Peter Ould's</a> blog is a video interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/gavinashenden">Gavin Ashenden</a>, a Canon in the Church of England and one of the Queen's chaplains. He does a bit of an analysis of the current state of the Church of England and makes some observations about its future, particularly about what it must do to be faithful in the coming years.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aYYdh4">God’s Plan A</a></strong> – The folks from <a href="http://www.homeforgood.org.uk">Home for Good</a>, a initiative launched by the <a href="http://www.eauk.org">Evangelical Alliance</a> to promote fostering and adoption in the church, contacted my wife about writing a short piece for <em><a href="http://www.threadsuk.com/">threads</a></em> on our adoption story, which you can read here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aN8e2r">The Second Vocational Reformation</a></strong> – An encouraging post from <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a> on the movement to recover a biblical view of vocation. Since we spend so much of our lives working, this is one of the most important areas in which Christians must learn to be faithful. It also is the single biggest area where our faithfulness could have a huge impact on the cities we live in.</li>
