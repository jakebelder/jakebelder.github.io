<p>We attended a local Anglican church today. The church we usually attend does not typically observe the liturgical calender, with the exception of the major holidays, so it kind of slipped my mind that today was All Saints' Day (although last night being Halloween should have tipped me off). We heard the beautiful words of this collect from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_common_prayer"><span style="font-style: italic;">Book of Common Prayer</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Almighty God, who hast knit together thine elect in one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of Your Son, Christ our Lord: Give us grace so to follow Your blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living, that we may come to those ineffable joys that thou hast prepared for those who unfeignedly love thee; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth, one God, in glory everlasting. Amen.
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, the words of Hebrews 12:1-2 are fitting for this day as well.</p>
<blockquote>
Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></blockquote>

We can't forget that although the saints have come to that "ineffable joy" the collect speaks of&mdash;indeed, how could the being in the presence of God be described in any other way&mdash;that joy is not yet complete. Only when Christ returns in glory will that joy be <span style="font-style: italic;">fully</span> complete, where we will enjoy, in the deepest sense of the word, the glory of His consummated Kingdom and the new creation. Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> is the goal of this race which we run.
