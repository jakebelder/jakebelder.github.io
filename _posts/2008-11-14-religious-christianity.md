Here is something to consider, from John Peck and Charles Strohmer's, *[Uncommon Sense: God's Wisdom for our Complex and Changing World](http://books.google.com/books?id=G320AAAACAAJ&dq=uncommon+sense:+God%27s+wisdom+for+our+complex+and+changing+world)*:

<blockquote>
There are many Christians who have a lot of trouble with [the religious aspect of life]. One of the most common expressions of this in our time are those who bristle at any notion that Christianity should be 'religious.' They will say of themselves in no uncertain terms, 'We're not religious,' or that they like their church because 'it's not religious.' We, the authors, can appreciate what is behind this attitude, which is a kind of prophetic statement against worship and devotion that has become static, ritualistic, legalistic, hypocritical, and so on. It is therefore not uncommon to hear Christians arguing for non-religious Christianity. And we can appreciate what is behind that too, a seeking after ways to become dynamic, spontaneous, grace-filled fellowships serving each other. The way ahead, however, is not to hammer the religious aspect to pieces. What people are thoroughly frustrated about is the abuse and distortion of the features that constitute overtly religious life: worship, devotion, confession, prayer, witness, the preaching and teaching, and so on. The way to address this is not to wipe out the religious dimension of life (can't do that anyway, because it's ordained by God) but to work within it to renew what's gone wrong. The irony is that many of the 'non-religious' Christians are doing this; they just don't recognize their work of renewal as life within the religious aspect (307).
