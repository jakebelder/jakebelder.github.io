Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 1px 0px 20px; width: 420px; height: 285px;"><a href="http://instagram.com/p/uQAPGPLUfS/" target="_blank"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/IMG_20141017_112006.jpg" width="420"></a></div>
Here are the links from the week of <strong>12-18 October 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZnfJg4">Christian worship is boring</a></strong> – An interesting post on the formative role of worship. The author says it is meant to be 'a long term education in becoming un-excited.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ENYsgQ">Church Planting Essentials: Patience</a></strong> – Great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/simplepastor">Phil Whittall</a> on learning to be at peace waiting to see God work: 'We believe that Jesus intends to build His church and has asked us to help. So we do what we’re told and we wait.' He's writing from the vantage point of a church planter, but I think this applies to just about everyone in ministry in the West.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1z9BQY3">Tom Wright on Dooyeweerd and Kuyper</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebishopuk">Steve Bishop</a> posts an interesting Google Translate-translated article from a Dutch website (hint: it's a bit hard to read) in which <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/staff/ntw2/">Tom Wright</a> talks about the ways he has been influenced by Dutch Reformed thinkers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Dooyeweerd">Herman Dooyeweerd</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ru4UPG">Why Study Theology?</a></strong> – Here is an good and thoughtful piece from <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/staff/jbw5/">John Webster</a> on why the study of theology is so crucial for ministry.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://n.pr/1sfi4nE">Forget Facebook, Abandon Instagram, Move To A Village</a></strong> – This is an interesting piece on the benefits of village life, particularly in terms of social and societal factors. There are potentially some insights for the church here, not least the discussion of the ideal size of a village.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1CnZmNf">Retirement Home Christianity</a></strong> – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mouw">Richard Mouw</a> offers a really helpful post on why you can't preach the same thing in every context.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1tybtZi">Ladies: Give Us Your Most Productive Years, We'll Hold Your Eggs For You</a></strong> – If you need yet another example of how broken the world is, here are some companies who are willing to pay to freeze a woman's eggs during her most productive working years so they can get the most out of their female employees. Yes, this is for real.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1vmDb9Y">When a Pastor Resigns Abruptly</a></strong> – In light of a rather big event in the American evangelical world this week, here is a really thoughtful piece on the dangers of pride in ministry. Always check your character, or better, have someone do it for you.</li>
