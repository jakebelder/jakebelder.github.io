<p>Last week, there was an interesting online exchange between Paul Levy, pastor of the <a href="http://www.ipc-ealing.co.uk/staff.html" target="_blank">International Presbyterian Church</a> in Ealing, London, and <a href="https://twitter.com/_JohnStevens" target="_blank">John Stevens</a>, the director of the <a href="http://www.fiec.org.uk/" target="_blank">Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches</a>, on whether or not baptists and paedo-baptists could co-exist in a body like the FIEC. <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/10/a-question-for-fiec.php" target="_blank">Levy suggested that they couldn't</a>, while Stevens said the FIEC <a href="http://www.john-stevens.com/2012/11/answering-paul-levy-where-are-all.html" target="_blank">would love to have some paedo-baptist churches</a> join their association. <em>[Update: <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/11/why-paedobaptism-leads-to-pres.php" target="_blank">Levy has published a response</a> to Stevens' post.]</em> This might be a conversation that is only of interest to evangelicals in the UK, but I think it raises some good questions about what unity looks like in a situation where baptismal theology differs.</p>
<p>As a paedo-baptist, I find this quite an interesting discussion.  Before I moved to England, an English friend of mine with an FIEC  background suggested I consider looking for an opportunity to serve in  an FIEC church. Since arriving here, I've met a number of people in the  FIEC, including Stevens, who I had privilege of meeting earlier this  year at a conference, and I know they are passionate about seeing the  Kingdom extended here in the UK. But for a number of reasons, baptism  being a significant one, I ended up pursuing opportunities in the  Anglican church, and that is where I currently serve.</p>
<p>Let me make a few observations first about Stevens' response to Levy,  before I add a few thoughts of my own. Stevens says first that the FIEC  wants to be an association that welcomes pastors and churches which  hold to paedo-baptist convictions because that is part of the nature of  the FIEC. The FIEC, Stevens writes, is 'a mutual support association of  autonomous local churches' and therefore 'it is a fundamental principle  of the FIEC that every local church has the right to determine for  itself how it should practice on matters outside of the core gospel  convictions'.</p>
<p>Stevens continues by asking where the paedo-baptists are, and suggests that, for a number of different reasons, evangelicals of  paedo-baptist conviction have instead found a home in bodies like the  Church of England or Church of Scotland, although he suggests they would  probably feel much more at home in the FIEC. He goes on to make what I  think is a rather unfair comment: 'Admittedly many conservative  evangelicals within these denominations hold relatively loosely to  paedo-baptism, but it seems to me that the understandable attractions of  social status, funded training provision and lovely historic buildings,  has led many who ought theologically to be independent paedo-Baptists  to set aside ecclesiological questions of church government and join  these denominations.'</p>
<p>Much could be said in response to this, but all I will say at this  point is that none of these reasons led me to the Anglican church, and I  for one am very firm in my paedo-baptist convictions. But it is  interesting that Stevens turns the discussion to matters of church  government, and sees that as the primary issue here instead of baptism  itself. I do not claim to speak for other evangelicals in the Church of  England, but this is again is not true for me; I am increasingly  convinced that the Bible is largely silent on the matter of how churches  should be governed, and could be happy serving in a variety of  ecclesiological contexts (although I do see benefits in belonging to  confessional traditions).</p>

<p>And so, while Stevens might think this is fundamentally about questions of ecclesiology (and to a degree, it is), I think the issue of baptism is still the main point in this conversation. In response to Stevens, then, I want to suggest that the central question  here is this: <strong><em>How</em> will baptists and paedo-baptists exist together in the FIEC? What will that look like?</strong></p>
<p>The FIEC may want to, as Stevens says, welcome paedo-baptists into  their association of churches, but there is one major hurdle in  baptismal theology that needs to be overcome, and that is the validity  of the different modes of baptism. Paedo-baptists are happy to welcome  baptists into their churches because they believe that their baptism is  valid. And this is because it is God's unchanging and eternal covenant promises to his people that validate baptism. The reverse, however, is largely untrue, and most baptists require  someone baptised as an infant to be re-baptised before they are accepted  as members of the church.</p>
<p>If the FIEC really wishes to welcome paedo-baptist pastors and  churches into their association, then they need to be intentional about  being a dual-practice body across the board. That is, while each local  church can define itself as baptist or paedo-baptist, they all need to  accept the validity of each other's baptism and allow members to freely  transfer between churches. To be sure, each church can be free to  continue to uphold its practice and require its leaders to subscribe to its particular  theological position on baptism. However, when it comes to the question  of the validity of a baptism, both must be upheld as legitimate and  valid in order for true unity to exist and for both baptists and paedo-baptists to find a home in the association.</p>
<p>In the end, I think Levy is right to be sceptical about the reality  of this happening. And though it would be nice to be proved wrong, I  think this is one of the weaknesses of a non-confessional body.  Evangelicals can and do foster unity in mission with other evangelicals,  since that unity is built on the foundational truths of the gospel and a  shared desire to see the Kingdom advanced, and that is a unity I applaud  and support. But the reality is that without a more robust theological basis, a  deeper unity between churches will be harder to come by. Someone like  myself may welcome the invitation from the FIEC to join their  association, but as a paedo-baptist, it will be very hard to feel united  with a church that does not recognise the validity of my baptism.</p>
