<p>Some good advice from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Owen_%28theologian%29">John Owen</a> on being modest and prudent when dealing with contentious theological issues:</p>
<blockquote>
I must desire you, that when ye hear an objection, ye would not be carried away with the sound of words, nor suffer it to take impression on your spirits, remembering with how many demonstrations and innumerable places of Scripture the truth opposed by them hath been confirmed, but rest yourselves until the places be well weighed, the arguments pondered, the answers set down; and then the Lord direct you to 'prove all things, and hold fast to that which is good' (1 Thess. 5:21).
</blockquote>

While the context here is the discussion of universal redemption around which his treatise, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Christ-Controversy-Universal-Redemption/dp/0851513824/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1230579092&amp;sr=8-1">The Death of Death in the Death of Christ</a>,</span> centers, the point stands for dealing with any theological issue we may find ourselves confronted with.
