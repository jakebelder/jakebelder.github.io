<p>This is the time of year when the various <a href="http://thegospelpartnerships.org.uk/" target="_blank">Gospel Partnerships</a> across the UK hold their annual conferences. <a href="http://thegospelpartnerships.org.uk/network/app/partnership/2/title/Midlands-Gospel-Partnership" target="_blank">The Midlands Partnership</a> held their conference this past week, and invited <a href="https://twitter.com/greggilbert" target="_blank">Greg Gilbert</a> to speak. <a href="http://twitter.com/_JohnStevens" target="_blank">John Stevens</a>, director of the <a href="http://www.fiec.org.uk/" target="_blank">FIEC</a>, tweeted this a few days ago highlighting something Gilbert said:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/tweet1.png" /></p>
<p>I don't know much about Gilbert, although I know he <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2011/11/what-is-the-mission-of-the-church-by-kevin-deyoung-greg-gilbert-a-review/" target="_blank">co-wrote a book with Kevin DeYoung which received wide criticism</a> for its narrow understanding of the gospel and the mission of the church. I want to be charitable to what Stevens' tweet suggested Gilbert said, and so I presume he was doing so in reaction to a tendency in some circles to overemphasize something like the transformation of cities and cultures at the expense of actually doing the work of evangelism. In this case, he makes a fair point. However, as I read the tweet, I couldn't help but hear Dorothy Sayers' words ringing in my ears again: “How can anyone remain interested in a religion which seems to have no concern with nine-tenths of his life?”</p>
<p>A short time after seeing the tweet above, I saw the one from <a href="http://twitter.com/JonTyson" target="_blank">Jon Tyson</a> below:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/tweet2.png" /></p>
<p>As you can tell by the fact that I retweeted it, I have much more sympathy with Tyson's perspective. I'm not suggesting that Tyson's tweet is 'the gospel', but merely reveals a better understanding of the scope of the gospel. The problem with Gilbert's perspective goes back again to what happens when we have <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/what-is-the-answer-to-narrow-and-trivial-christianity" target="_blank">a gospel and a theology that is not firmly rooted in the doctrine of creation</a>. Christians have <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html" target="_blank">a mandate to bear witness to the lordship of Christ over all of life</a>, and it is imperative that we, as God's people carrying out our mission in this world, understand the massive implications of the fact that Christ's redemption restores the whole of creation.</p>

I could go on, but this clearly highlights the reality that, within the evangelical world, there are widely divergent understandings of the gospel and the mission of the church. However, this is not a divergence we should feel comfortable with. Much work needs to be done to recover <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/a-tim-keller-definition-of-the-gospel" target="_blank">a fuller understanding of the gospel</a> and the mission of the church. The gospel is not just about the salvation of souls because Christ does not just rule as Lord over our souls. Instead, he rules as Lord over the whole of creation. And our gospel simply <em>must</em> take that into account.
