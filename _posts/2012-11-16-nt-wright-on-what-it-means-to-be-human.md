<p>Over the last couple of weeks as I have wandered the streets of Hull, I have had the opportunity to listen to three lectures <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright" target="_blank">N.T. Wright</a> gave at a conference the <a href="http://www.wysocs.org.uk/index.php" target="_blank">West Yorkshire School of Christian Studies</a> hosted in 2010. The theme of the conference was 'Human flourishing in tomorrow's world', and Wright spoke on the subjects of wisdom, glory, and virtue, using each as a way to explore what it means to be truly human. The lectures are absolutely brilliant, and well worth taking the time to listen to or to watch. This is the vision of human flourishing that we need &ndash; one that is firmly rooted in Scripture, and embraces and celebrates the new life we have in Christ in all its fullness.</p>
