Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Since I missed last week's post, here are the links from <strong>18-31 August 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16miAFl">The Dying (No, Really) Of Liberal Protestantism</a></strong> – All the statistics point to the reality that the church as a whole is getting smaller in the West. But it's the liberal churches that are dying the quickest. The church is getting smaller overall, but it's also getting more orthodox.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13zoTHE">How to Stand for Classical Anglicanism in the Midst of Anglican Pluralism</a></strong> – This is a really good post on the need to recover a positive Anglican identity in an age when 'classical Anglicans' (the label the author uses) keep getting pressured to identify themselves by what they're not. He encourages us to think like evangelists, to answer the big questions: 'What is our central message? What do we believe? What do we teach? What is our message to the culture that we live in? What hope do we have to share with the world?'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14wFrer">Architect Student Converts Old Bus into Comfy Mobile Home</a></strong> – This is different from the sorts of things I usually share, but I thought it was a really neat idea.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dodEUn">Sleeper Cells for the Common Good: A Conversation with David Brooks</a></strong> – Here is a great conversation between <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nytdavidbrooks">David Brooks</a> on the common good, the possibility of cultural change, institutions, and the world of politics. There are some really interesting insights here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14ysdxA">Ten Things a Vicar Needs to Hear...Often</a></strong> – This is a helpful post on ways to encourage and support your church leaders. Although it is written for an Anglican audience (hence the use of the title 'vicar'), it applies to any pastor or minister. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://huff.to/16vEy8W">23 Signs You're Secretly An Introvert</a></strong> – One of the reasons I was drawn to this post was because of how much I identify with it. I've always known I'm more of an introvert, but this just helped me realise the extent to which I am.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16ywRPk">Alister McGrath on Anglo-Catholicism</a></strong> – <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mcgrath/">Alistair McGrath</a> writes about the way the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Movement">Oxford Movement</a> attempted to redefine Anglicanism as something other than Protestant, a tendency which continues today amongst those who understand the <em>via media</em> as something between Protestantism and Catholicism. McGrath rightly notes, however, that it is 'historically indefensible' to separate Anglicanism from Protestantism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dv1c58">Knitting While Detroit Burns?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> challenges the idea that the best way to promote the common good and make a difference in a community is through localised small efforts. He observes that while those small efforts have their place, in a context like Detroit, we need big, systemic change if any difference is going to be made. Christians need to be engaged in both small and large cultural labours.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13HMFBo">Beyond Eclectic Christianity</a></strong> – Many people like the idea of drawing on a variety of traditions to shape their theology, but the author of this piece rightly argues that we must be grounded in one tradition before we begin to glean the wisdom from other traditions. Without being rooted in a tradition, we won't have the necessary lenses to help us critically engage other traditions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14JRvJ9">Our Offerings, Our Work</a></strong> – I must admit that I've rarely thought about the significance of the offertory in worship, but this post encourages us to do so, and provides some helpful thoughts to mull over.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/KYNBdrFR5Bo">Knowing vs. Feeling in Worship</a></strong> – Here is a great clip from <a href="http://www.truthforlife.org/about/about-alistair-begg/">Alistair Begg</a> on why worship can't be about what we feel, but needs to be grounded in what we know.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/new_future_sought_for_suburbs/6793451">New future sought for suburbs</a></strong> – Finland has recognised the value of getting residents involved in suburban renewal projects as they think about how to improve on the existing suburban areas in Helsinki. This seems to me to be a great idea.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/what-the-hijabi-witnessed-and-what-she-didnt.php">What the Hijabi Witnessed (and What She Didn't)</a></strong> – Here is a good post from <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html">Carl Trueman</a> on the power of the Anglican liturgy. He observes how Thomas Cranmer designed the liturgy to be saturated with Scripture, such that when a tourist comes for an evensong service, they will hear more Scripture than in many other church services. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://actstwo39.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/the-church-is-not-the-people/">The Church Is Not the People</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DaveKetter">Dave Ketter</a> writes an interesting post reflecting on the common notion that the church is the people. Don't worry, though – he doesn't say that it is the building!</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://luhambo.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/the-giving-and-receiving-of-belonging/">The giving and receiving of belonging</a></strong> – I wrote a piece this week for an online journal called '<a href="http://luhambo.wordpress.com/">Luhambo</a>', edited by <a href="http://twitter.com/elishevavigilia">Elizabeth Viljoen</a>. It is a bit of a reflection on the idea of 'belonging'.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/christians-may-be-bombed-for-that-it.html">Christians may be bombed, for that is convention. Muslims may not be gassed, for that is taboo</a></strong> – Some poignant words from <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace">Archbishop Cranmer</a> during this time of unrest in Syria in particular, and the Middle East in general.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.sbts.edu/resources/magazines/a-gospel-imperative-christian-leadership-in-a-digital-age/">A Gospel Imperative: Christian Leadership in a Digital Age </a></strong> – This is an interesting post from <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/about/">Albert Mohler</a> making the case for Christian leaders to be engaged online.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.fieldnotesmagazine.com/admin/living-in-the-time-of-gods-patience/">At work in the time of God’s patience</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a> has some really helpful thoughts on the question, 'How do we make sense of all the very good work being done by people who are not motivated by the gospel?'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://vimeopro.com/ivpress/andycrouchon">Andy Crouch On:</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc">Andy Crouch</a> has a new book coming out in October called, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/083084404X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=083084404X&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Playing God</a></em>, and here are six short videos in which he briefly discusses some of the big ideas from the book. I'm really looking forward to reading this one.</li>
