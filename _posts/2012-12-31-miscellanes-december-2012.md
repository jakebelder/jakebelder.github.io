<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted here at the end of the week. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of December together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>December 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/52a20d7a17de" target="_blank"><strong>Why I love Twitter and barely tolerate Facebook</strong></a> - This is good, and I largely agree. Twitter is all about the present, it demands far less time than Facebook, and it's way more fun.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/reject-apathy/worldview/serving-justice-vs-saving-souls" target="_blank"><strong>Serving Justice vs. Saving Souls</strong></a> - <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/" target="_blank">RELEVANT magazine</a> ran an excellent piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland" target="_blank">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> this week on the holistic mission of the church. Tim argues that we need to get past the old paradigm that says churches either get involved in social justice, or they do evangelism, and recognise instead that they are both a necessary part of the church's mission in the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-have-made.html" target="_blank"><strong>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have made a foetus</strong></a> - Here is a very interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Cranmer</a> on how the largely pro-choice media is quick to announce the conception of the royal <em>baby</em>. He asks, 'Are royal foetuses endowed with full humanity from the point of conception?'</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.christianitytoday.com/women/2012/12/why-mark-driscoll-is-wrong-abo.html" target="_blank"><strong>Why Mark Driscoll is Wrong About Twilight</strong></a> - Not surprisingly, for those who know Driscoll, he has come out swinging against the evils of the <em>Twilight</em> series of books and films. But in this very interesting and provocative post, the author argues that <em>Twilight's </em>troubling take on love actually overlaps with Driscoll's teachings on men and women.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/54603241" target="_blank">A Trinitarian Gospel</a></strong> - The <a href="http://www.eauk.org/" target="_blank">Evangelical Alliance</a> is hosting a national consultation on the question, 'What is the gospel?' Here <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_reeves" target="_blank">Mike Reeves</a> addresses the importance of why our gospel needs to take into account a Trinitarian God. It's a great talk, well worth taking nine minutes to listen to.</li>
<li><a href="http://robhadding.com/?p=43&amp;buffer_share=a091e&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Children in Church</strong></a> - A case is made here for not sending children out of the church service. The author here challenges a lot of the assumptions evangelicals make about children in worship, and encourages us to re-think the importance of children being a part of our corporate worship.</li>
<li><a href="http://gardensdontlaunch.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/read-contemplate-write/" target="_blank"><strong>Read, Contemplate, Write</strong></a> - Here is a great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager" target="_blank">Andy Stager</a>, a church planter in South Carolina, on on the importance of reading, writing, and contemplating in the early years of ministry for the purpose of theological and spiritual formation.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/avoiding_trinity" target="_blank">Avoiding Trinity</a></strong> - Here's a great post on why you simply cannot avoid the Trinity if you read the New Testament. The Trinity is unavoidable if you want to know who Jesus is, and this then also has bearing on how we share the gospel with people.</li>
<li><a href="http://christthetruth.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/what-is-sin/" target="_blank"><strong>What is sin? Falling short? Rebellion? Something else?</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/glenscrivener" target="_blank">Glen Scrivener</a> discusses the essence of sin in this interesting post and suggests that it is not helpful to understand the essence of sin as fundamentally rebellion against God. That is certainly an effect of sin, he says, but not the essence. This is worth further discussion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://danielsilliman.blogspot.de/2012/12/mark-driscoll-on-pot-sloppy-lazy-deeply.html" target="_blank">Mark Driscoll on pot: sloppy, lazy, and deeply unserious</a></strong> - Driscoll has recently published an e-book on the question of whether or not it is okay for a Christian to use pot. Essentially he says that those who do need to grow up and become real men. The same goes for those who use public transportation. No, really. He actually says that. Follow the link to read <a href="http://danielsilliman.blogspot.de/" target="_blank">Daniel Silliman's</a> helpful critique of the book and of Driscoll's (and Mars Hill's) method of addressing subjects like these.</li>
<li><a href="http://headhearthand.org/blog/2012/12/11/tullian-keeps-digging/" target="_blank"><strong>Tullian keeps digging</strong></a> - This is very interesting. <a href="http://twitter.com/davidpmurray" target="_blank">David Murray</a> takes the time to analyze what he suggests is a dangerous trajectory in Tchividjian's theology. I have not paid enough attention to this debate to really say anything about it, but it does seem as if this is just another manifestation of the trend amongst the New Calvinists to be <a href="http://jakebelder.com/66155993" target="_blank">very wary of speaking about righteousness</a>, of going too far the other way to avoid works-righteousness.</li>
<li> <strong><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2012/12/do-microphones-encourage-poor-preaching" target="_blank">How Microphones Muffle Good Preaching</a></strong> - Should preachers stop using microphones? That's what the author of this post suggests we consider. It's a bit of a curious argument, and perhaps comes out of his own bad experience. In my experience, though, a microphone has no bearing on the tone and style of preaching. These are determined more by factors such as the size of the room or congregation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mereorthodoxy.com/are-the-metro-evangelicals-right/" target="_blank"><strong>Are the Metro-Evangelicals Right?</strong></a> - The urban, city-centre church planting trend continues, and while  many suggest it is strategic to the church's mission, others think the  rhetoric is a bit over the top. The author of this article suggests  there are some questions that need to be asked and assumptions that need  to be challenged.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/opinion/sunday/the-decline-of-evangelical-america.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;buffer_share=2a675&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">The Decline of Evangelical America</a></strong> - This was quite an interesting post reflecting on the changing  landscape of evangelical culture in America. Particularly interesting is  the analysis of how American evangelicalism is self-destructing, and  the positive changes that may come out of that.</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/this-advent-what-are-you-waiting-for/" target="_blank"><strong>This Advent: what are you waiting for?</strong></a> - <a href="http://www.allsouls.org" target="_blank">All Souls' Langham Place</a> recorded a few videos of people from the church doing some Advent  readings for their Advent carol service. They are all good, but the  readings from Psalm 130 and Isaiah 64 in particular are very powerful.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://theaquilareport.com/radicalizing-the-middle-class/" target="_blank">Radicalizing the Middle Class</a></strong> - Randy Nabors, a pastor in Tennessee, notes, "the Evangelical middle  class is too secure in its justification of self-centeredness." This is a  hard but challenging post, well worth taking the time to read.</li>
<li><a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/wanted-believing-bishops-for-salvation.html" target="_blank"><strong>Wanted: Believing Bishops for the Salvation of the Nation</strong></a> - Here is a great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ugleyvicar" target="_blank">John Richardson</a> on how easily we are getting distracted by other issues when what we  really need in the Church of England are godly, biblical leaders who are  at working hard at spreading the gospel throughout England.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/blog/2012/12/blinded-by-the-light" target="_blank"><strong>Blinded by the Light</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/BrianDijkema" target="_blank">Brian Dijkema</a> has some good Christmas reflections here, and helps us think about how to understand the light coming into the darkness in a world where we don't really know what darkness is anymore.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/leithart/2012/12/22/how-nt-wright-stole-christmas/" target="_blank">How N.T. Wright Stole Christmas</a></strong> - <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart" target="_blank">Peter Leithart</a> discusses N.T. Wright's view on many Christmas songs, which unlike Advent hymns, miss the point about the Messiah coming to redeem Israel. He concludes, "I suggest a moratorium on new Christmas hymns, until we all learn the  Magnificat and the Benedictus and the Nunc Dimittis so much by heart  that they seep out our fingers at the keyboard, until we instinctively  sing of Jesus&rsquo; birth like Mary, like Zecharias, like Simeon."</li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/bjQDl95tOcU" target="_blank"><strong>O Little Town of Bethlehem</strong></a> - Here is a five-minute video of the story of the birth of Jesus told by the people who currently live in Bethlehem. This is really good.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.peter-ould.net/2012/12/28/2013-the-anglicans-to-watch/" target="_blank"><strong>2013 &ndash; The Anglicans to Watch</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld" target="_blank">Peter Ould</a> compiles a list of ten Anglicans he thinks will significantly shape the Church of England this year. There is quite a variety of people on this interesting list.</li>
