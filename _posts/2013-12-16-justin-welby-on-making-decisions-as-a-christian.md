The notion of 'doing God's will' is one that Christians spend a great deal of time thinking about, although we often find ourselves looking for the answer to this question in all the wrong places. I've written before that, in one sense, [the answer to the question of how to do God's will is simply to grow in godliness](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/how-to-do-gods-will), seeking to be transformed more and more by Scripture. The Archbishop of Canterbury, [Justin Welby](http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/about-justin-welby.html), offers some thoughts in this short clip that get at the same thing. I particularly appreciate his comment, 'If my sense of what I should do doesn't fit with the Bible, then I'm wrong.' This is really quite helpful:<br>
