<p>A couple of years ago, I&nbsp;wrote a number of posts&nbsp;trying to work  through <a href="http://jakebelder.com/tag/sabbath" target="_blank">how  to understand and practice the Sabbath</a>. Too often, I think, we look at the Sabbath through one of two lenses: the first has us thinking about what we are not supposed to do on the Sabbath, and the second has us saying that as long as we go to church, the rest of the day is free for us to do whatever we want.</p>
<p>My point is simply that in thinking about the Sabbath this way, we are making it about us actively doing something, and so we have missed the point of the Sabbath altogether. Yesterday morning I was reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christ-Plays-Ten-Thousand-Places/dp/0802828752/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268776839&amp;sr=8-1">Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</a></em>, and came to a part where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Peterson">Eugene Peterson</a> talks about the need for a Sabbath:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is no Sabbath&mdash;no regular and commanded not-working,  not-talking&mdash;we soon become totally absorbed in what we are doing and  saying, and God's work is either forgotten or marginalized. When we work  we are most god-like, which means that it is in our work that it is  easiest to develop god-pretensions. Un-sabbathed, our work becomes the  entire context in which we define our lives.We lose God-consciousness,  God-awareness, sightings of resurrection. We lose the capacity to sing  'This is my Father's world' and end up chirping little self-centered  ditties about what we are doing and feeling.<br><br>

This is a most difficult command to keep, a most difficult practice  to cultivate. It is one of the most abused and distorted practices of  the Christian life. Many through the centuries have suffered much under  oppressive Sabbath regimens. And more than a few of us have been among  the oppressors. It is difficult to assemble a congregation of Christians  today that does not number in its company both oppressed and  oppressors. John gives us accounts of two of Jesus' Sabbath healings  (chapters 5 and 9) that serve as serious warnings against glib or  legalistic or oppressive Sabbath practices. Jesus spent a good deal of  his time at odds with people who had wrong ideas about keeping Sabbath.  (See also Mark 3:1-6; 3:23-30; Luke 14:1-6). And one contributing cause  of their wrong ideas was that they had severed the connection between  Sabbath and work.<br><br>

But I don't see any way out of it: if we are going to live  appropriately in the creation we must keep the Sabbath. We must stop  running around long enough to see what he has done and is doing. We must  shut up long enough to hear what he has said and is saying. All our  ancestors agree that without silence and stillness there is no  spirituality, no God-attentive, God-responsive life.
</blockquote>
<p>For Peterson, then, the Sabbath is not about keeping a set of rules, but resting in order to take the focus off of ourselves and look to God. We rest from our toils in order both to imitate God's rest from his creative work, and as a means of remembering the rest we find in redemption.</p>

More to come on this. Maybe.
