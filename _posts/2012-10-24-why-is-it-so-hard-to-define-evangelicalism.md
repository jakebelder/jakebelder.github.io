<p>The last time <a href="http://jakebelder.com/church-membership-and-submission" target="_blank">I posed a big question on this blog</a> for discussion, some good conversation ensued. So let me try this  again, by directing your attention to a question put forward the other  night by <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">who you should follow</a>, by the way). He tweeted this:</p>

<p>It is a question that is, of course, highly contentious, and in many  ways, unanswerable. Alastair later tweeted that there seems to be a  distinction between a theological definition of evangelicalism, and a  sociological one. I think he is right, and I wonder if that is perhaps  one way of categorising the difference between American evangelicalism  and the variant of evangelicalism we see here in the UK. When I lived in  America, it was very clear that to be an evangelical was much more of a  sociological distinction &ndash; it generally meant you attended a  non-denominational church that upheld the authority of the Bible,  understood your faith to be largely a matter of your individual  relationship with Jesus Christ, voted Republican, and more than likely  lived in a middle class suburban area. This seems to be changing  somewhat, although that is a much bigger discussion.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, however, evangelicalism seems to be more of a  theological definition, shaped by certain convictions and beliefs, as  well as ecclesial practices. That being said, there seems to be two  variants of this definition. There is a theoretical definition, which to  some degree or another is spelled out on paper, and a functional  definition, which tends, in my opinion, to operate with much more  restrictive boundaries.</p>
<p>What exactly constitutes the theoretical boundaries of orthodoxy in  evangelicalism is somewhat disputed. Some will say these boundaries are  established by ancient documents like the Nicene Creed. Others prefer  something more robust, like a confessional document. For the purposes of  this discussion, however, let's say that the statement of faith from  the <a href="http://www.uccf.org.uk" target="_blank">Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship</a> establishes those boundaries (and indeed, it is often considered a benchmark definition of evangelicalism here in the UK):</p>
<ol class="long-item-list" type="a">
<li>There is one God in three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>God is sovereign in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgement.</li>
<li>The Bible, as originally given, is the inspired and infallible Word    of God. It is the supreme authority in all matters of belief and    behaviour. </li>
<li>Since the fall, the whole of humankind is sinful and guilty, so that everyone is subject to God's wrath and condemnation.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus Christ, God's incarnate Son, is fully God; he was   born of a virgin; his humanity is real and sinless; he died on the   cross, was raised bodily from death and is now reigning over heaven and   earth.</li>
<li>Sinful human beings are redeemed from the guilt, penalty and power   of sin only through the sacrificial death once and for all time of their   representative and substitute, Jesus Christ, the only mediator between   them and God.</li>
<li>Those who believe in Christ are pardoned all their sins and accepted   in God's sight only because of the righteousness of Christ credited to   them; this justification is God's act of undeserved mercy, received   solely by trust in him and not by their own efforts.</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit alone makes the work of Christ effective to   individual sinners, enabling them to turn to God from their sin and to   trust in Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit lives in all those he has regenerated. He makes them   increasingly Christlike in character and behaviour and gives them  power  for their     witness in the world.</li>
<li>The one holy universal church is the Body of Christ, to which all true believers belong.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus Christ will return in person, to judge everyone, to   execute God's just condemnation on those who have not repented and to   receive the redeemed to eternal glory.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a decent statement of faith, and certainly covers key points of  Christian orthodoxy. On paper, if we were to say that this constitutes  the boundaries of evangelicalism, then the evangelical camp would be a  large one, containing churches and believers from a variety of  traditions across the spectrum.</p>

<p>However, I want to suggest that <em>functionally</em>, this is not  the case. Though evangelicalism might be defined this way, the reality  seems to be that the boundaries are tighter, especially within what is commonly referred to as the conservative evangelical camp. The first example that  springs to mind, of course, is the issue of women serving in leadership  roles in the church, particularly in an ordained capacity. Though a  statement like the one above says nothing about it, some evangelicals  seem to want to deny the title of evangelical to those who ordain women.  But there are other issues as well &ndash; for instance, can those whose  worship belongs to a more liturgical, 'high-church' variety be  considered evangelicals? What about those with charismatic leanings?</p>
<p>The problem is that we simply don't have a clear defintion of what it  means to be an evangelical. Everybody wants to claim the title, but  nobody wants to share it. And the line between theoretical and  functional definitions of the term have been drawn and re-drawn so many  times that I wonder if it is even possible to recover a definition, or  if the term will be relegated to obscurity. Is it even worth discussing a definition anymore? Perhaps  we ought to be more concerned with upholding  orthodox expressions of our various traditions.</p>

But I end my musings here and open up the conversation to the rest of  you. What do you think? In so far as it is even possible, what defines  an evangelical?
