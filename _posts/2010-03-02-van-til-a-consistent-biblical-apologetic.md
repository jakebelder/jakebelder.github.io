<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Van_Til">Cornelius Van Til</a> argued that Reformed theology demanded a Reformed apologetic, one based on its doctrine of God and doctrines of grace. <a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=25">John Muether</a>, in his excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cornelius-Van-Til-Apologist-Biographies/dp/0875526659/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267487390&amp;sr=8-4">biography of Van Til</a>, quotes him at length on this issue:</p>
<blockquote>
A generally evangelical apologetic to a large extent defeats its own purposes. True enough much good may be accomplished, both by an Arminian theology and by a generally evangelical method of apologetic. In this fact all who love the Lord will rejoice. But how much more good may be accomplished by the grace of God through a more consistently Biblical theology and a more consistenly Biblical apologetic. A generally evangelical apologetic does not drive the natural man down into a corner with no hope of escape. It does not track him down till he is at bay. It does not destroy his last shelter. His fire is not altogether extinguished...A plea for a vigorous apologetic ought therefore to be a plea for a genuinely Reformed apologetic. We may not be clear, indeed as to the full implications of a truly Reformed apologetic. But this fact does not justify us in refusing to point out those who, with us, love the Christian faith that a generally evanglical apologetic...is inadequate for any time and especially inadequate for our time.
</blockquote>
<p>Van Til's presuppositionalism reflected his debt to the theology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a>, who had written in the <a></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Dogmatics-Vol-1-Prolegomena/dp/0801026326/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267487504&amp;sr=8-2">first volume of his <em>Reformed Dogmatics</em></a> years earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
Apologetics cannot precede faith and does not attempt a priori to argue the truth of revelation. It assumes the truth and belief in the truth. It does not, as the introductory part or as the foundational science, precede theology and dogmatics. It is itself a theological science through and through, which presupposes the faith and dogmatics and now maintains and defends the dogma against the opposition to which it is exposed.<br><br>

...If Christian revelation, which presupposes the darkness and error of unspiritual humanity, submitted in advance to the judgments of reason, it would by that token contradict itself. It would thereby place itself before a tribunal whose jurisdiction it had first denied. And having once recognized the authority of reason on the level of first principles, it could no longer oppose that authority in the articles of faith.

<p>Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Van Til knows that the first thing he would do when entering a classroom is to draw the diagram you see at the left on the chalkboard. The two circle diagram was representative of the Creator-creature distinction, one which Van Til unapologetically (no pun intended) maintained was absolutely crucial to Christian thought. The two lines connecting the circles represented the covenantal relationship between God and man. Man, the creature, was always dependent on God, the Creator, and His revelation. The one circle on the left represented non-Christian thought, where any idea of "God" was rooted in the creature.</p>

It was for this reason that apologetics could never have its foundation in any thought that rejected the Creator-creature distinction. No vague notions of reason would suffice, neither would the idea that Christians and non-Christians could find some sort of neutral ground from which to engage in apologetics. And so he devoted himself to working out an apologetic that honoured the relationship between God and man and rooted itself fully in the revelation of God. For Van Til, there simply was no other way.
