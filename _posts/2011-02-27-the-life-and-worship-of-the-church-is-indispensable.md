[Evelyn Underhill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Underhill):

<blockquote>
The church is 'essential service' like the Post Office but there will always be some narrow, irritating and inadequate officials behind the counter and you will always be tempted to exasperation by them... [But] I feel the regular, steady, docile practice of corporate worship is of the utmost importance for building-up of your spiritual life...no amount of solitary reading or prayer makes up for the humble immersion in the life and worship of the church.
