<p>Every year, as the Christmas season comes around, two things happen which I do not understand. The first is that church attendance rises dramatically. Carol services or Christmas Day services are filled with people who otherwise never set foot in a church building. The second is that many recording artists produce and release Christmas albums, and are subsequently heard singing traditional Christmas hymns and carols in cafés and shops all over the place. The only conclusion I can draw is that these seasonal churchgoers and recording artists must not think about the words coming out of their mouths when they sing the traditional hymns of this season.</p>

<p>The church has many great hymns that proclaim the wonderful truths of the Christian faith, but I find that many of our Advent and Christmas hymns make those declarations in an especially poignant way. Every time I find myself in a carol service, I end up looking at the many unfamiliar faces gathered in the church, wondering why they are there and why they so readily sing these songs, some even with exuberance.</p>
<p>If people took a moment to think about the lyrics of the Advent and Christmas hymns, I wonder how they would react to something like the third verse of '<a href="http://nethymnal.org/htm/h/h/a/hhangels.htm">Hark! The Herald Angels Sing</a>':</p>
<blockquote>
Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!<br>
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!<br>
Light and life to all He brings,<br>
Ris'n with healing in His wings.<br>
Mild He lays His glory by,<br>
Born that man no more may die,<br>
Born to raise the sons of earth,<br>
Born to give them second birth.
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a song that joyfully expresses the wonder of the incarnation, and proclaims the salvation that has come through Jesus Christ. Other songs boldly present a challenge to those who have not confessed Christ as Lord, and demand a response. Consider this  verse, from '<a href="http://nethymnal.org/htm/j/o/joyworld.htm">Joy to the World</a>':</p>
<blockquote>
He rules the world with truth and grace,<br>
And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of His righteousness,<br>
And wonders of His love.
</blockquote>
<p>The first verse of '<a href="http://nethymnal.org/htm/o/h/oholynit.htm">O Holy Night</a>', calls us to join in the <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/le-monde-entier-tressaille-desperance">weary world's 'thrill of hope'</a> at the Saviour's coming, and to 'Fall on your knees!' in response. The text of another hymn, '<a href="http://nethymnal.org/htm/o/c/ocomeayf.htm">O Come, All Ye Faithful</a>', triumphantly proclaims that the true Lord, worthy of all praise and glory, has come:</p>
<blockquote>
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,<br>
Born this happy morning,<br>
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n!

<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm">Al Wolters</a> wrote <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/2328">an article</a> for the online version of <em>Comment</em> magazine, making a similar point about the 'Hallelujah Chorus' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel">Handel's</a> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_%28Handel%29">Messiah</a></em>. He notes that despite the overtly religious theme – that Jesus Christ is <em>the </em>Messiah and that he rules as King over all the earth – people  in our culture still stand up when the choir sings the majestic chorus.  What makes this especially interesting is the juxtaposition of the  confession of Christ as Lord, ruling over all the earth, with <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ps%202#q=&ref=Ps%202&ver=NIV">Psalm 2</a>, which is sung prior to the chorus. Wolters observes,</p>
<blockquote>
The meaning is unmistakable. The  nations at large conspire against the Lord and against his Anointed, and  plan to cast off all restraints that he has imposed on them. But God  will only laugh at their defiance, and he (now addressed in the second  person) will crush their rebellion and smash them like a piece of  pottery. Then the 'Hallelujah', with its celebration of the universal  triumph of God in Jesus Christ, is sung. And audiences across several  continents get to their feet in symbolic endorsement.
</blockquote>
<p>What do we make of this? Given what these songs proclaim, it is surprising that people who don't  consider themselves Christians continue to sing them (or even  celebrate Christmas, for that matter). Perhaps it is nothing more than a desire to hold on to old, comfortable cultural traditions; the fact that these songs remain so widely known certainly points to the vestiges of a  culture in which Christianity once had a more prominent place.</p>
<p>Still, how can so many people sing the words of these songs and not  be taken aback by the startling claims they make? One reason, perhaps, is their familiarity. Repetition is a funny tool; on the one hand, it helps us to remember things and shapes and forms us, which is why liturgy is so important. On the other hand, too much repetition, without any intentional formation, can dull the effect of the thing to be remembered. We hear these  songs played over and over again at this time of year in contexts where we are not forced to think about them, and it may just be that the profound declarations about the person of Jesus Christ no longer hit us with full force. Add to this the fact that these seasonal hymns are heard alongside the trivial and meaningless seasonal songs that have been produced over  the years, such as the patently ridiculous '<a href="http://www.41051.com/xmaslyrics/herecomes.html">Here Comes Santa Claus</a>', or the plethora of banal holiday love songs, and the power of the message of the church's  Advent and Christmas hymns is further diluted.</p>
<p>There is a challenge for the church here, then. When we host carol services or see unfamiliar faces coming in for Christmas Day services, we simply cannot let the opportunity pass by to point to Jesus. Singing these familiar songs needs to be accompanied by a faithful proclamation of the gospel, underscoring the reality of who Jesus is and what he came to do, and challenging the listeners to surrender their lives to the newborn King they sing of. We cannot let the bold hymns of Christmas just become happy carols to sing by candlelight.</p>

All that being said, it really is quite significant that during this  season, even in our day, people will repeatedly hear songs proclaiming  that Jesus is Lord broadcast over the airwaves or in their neighbourhoods or in churches all across our towns and cities. Despite the fact that it is just tradition for many people, it is great that they still come along, because they <em>will</em> hear about the Saviour of the world. Let's hope and pray that as they hear and sing these songs and find themselves confronted with the truth of the gospel, that they would be captivated  by the wonder and the promise of the incarnation, and fall on their  knees in worship before the Lord of heaven and earth.
