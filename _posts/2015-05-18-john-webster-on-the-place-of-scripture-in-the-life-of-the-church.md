[John Webster](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/staff/jbw5/), in his chapter in *[Perspectives on Ecclesiology and Ethnography](http://amzn.to/1H0p9lY)*, discusses the role of Scripture in the life of the Church. Commenting first on the nature of Scripture and how it works, he remarks:

<blockquote>
Holy Scripture is the unified canon of texts appointed by God as the herald of his self-publication. The canon is holy, that is, it is a set of creaturely textual acts sanctified to serve God’s revelatory presence. By the divine act of sanctification these creaturely acts are made fitting attestations of the divine Word. As a field of the Spirit’s operation in its production, Holy Scripture is inspired, that is, God undertakes that Scripture’s prophetic and apostolic authors give creaturely voice to what the Spirit says to the churches. As a field of the Spirit’s operation in its reception, Holy Scripture possesses clarity, because the Spirit who inspires Scripture also illuminates its readers, making the prophetic and apostolic word intelligible and effectual (218).
</blockquote>

It is on this basis that Webster goes on to argue for Scripture's authoritative place in the Church's life. Because of what it is, It must be recognised as the legitimate means of guiding the Church both in truth and action:

<blockquote>
As an attestation of the rule of Christ and his gospel, Holy Scripture is authoritative; in reading Holy Scripture the church receives an embassy from the church’s Lord, so that its speaking can legitimately require the attention that is properly given to the <em>viva vox Christi</em>. As that to which Christ entrusts the task of instructing the church, Holy Scripture is sufficient; it is not one of a number of potential creaturely mediations of revelation, but is fully adequate to guide the church into the comprehensive truth of the gospel. None of these affirmations entails thinking of Scripture as other than a creaturely product, but simply specifies the way in which God acts mediately through its testimony (a robust theology of mediated divine action provides release from a modern quandary according to which Scripture is either a purely natural religious product that represents the circumstances of its production, or a supernatural reality only incidentally related to creaturely processes)… [Holy Scripture] orders the church’s identity, both in relation to its divine ground and in relation to its temporal passage, and it also presents the imperative force of the divine work, as not just a condition in which the church rests but as a legitimate directive of the church’s action (218-219).
</blockquote>

In the context of [the book](http://amzn.to/1H0p9lY), Webster's comments come in response to those practical theologians who would be less inclined to give Scripture such authority, and in the end, he helpfully and persuasively articulates why its normative status must be retained.
