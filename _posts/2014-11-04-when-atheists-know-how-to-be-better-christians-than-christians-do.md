Alastair Sterne, lead pastor of [St Peter’s Fireside](http://www.stpetersfireside.org/), a new church plant in Vancouver, [says that his conversations with atheist friends](http://www.redeemercitytocity.com/blog/atheism-helps-my-faith) help him to grow in faith. The article is very interesting, and picks up on something that has struck me before – that sometimes atheists and others who are not Christians know how to be better Christians than we ourselves do. Good conversations with them can help not only to sharpen what we think and believe, but also to challenge us by exposing our blind spots. Sterne's recent conversation with an atheist friend about Scripture illustrates the point:

<blockquote>
One evening, my friend said "You Christians think that God wrote the Bible, right?" to which I said “That’s a rather blunt way of stating it, but sure.” He went on, "Here’s what I don’t understand. I ask Christians all the time if they read their Bible and they often say ‘No.’ Seriously? If I believed I had a book written by God I would read the s**t out of that book!"
</blockquote>

This kind of honesty about what Christian discipleship ought to look like reminded me of a video that made the rounds several years ago in which Penn Jillette (of [Penn & Teller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller) fame), a well-known atheist, made a clarion call for Christians to do evangelism:

I think there are two observations to make here. First, often as Christians we acknowledge that reading Scripture and doing evangelism are things we need to do more of, or do better. The problem is that we usually stop there and fail to take action, partly because we think that they are more private, hidden things that we can always work on later. But this, then, is a clear warning that these things are *not* hidden, and to hear a couple of atheists (rightly) call us out on the glaring inconsistencies in the practice of our faith ought to be humbling and challenging, and prompt us to act quickly for the sake of our witness in the world.

Second, I find it interesting that these atheists expect that discipleship will be something robust and all-encompassing. In the examples above, for instance, they expect us to take the authority of Scripture and the reality of heaven and hell very seriously, and to act accordingly. That again is a challenge to us in an age where it sometimes seems that the overriding concern of our witness is to make Christianity palatable. Here we are trying to make following Jesus more comfortable and less demanding in the belief that this will somehow make the Church more attractive to others, and people who are not Christians are telling us they have no respect for a religion that does not demand everything from you (which makes you wonder if we're really just redefining what it looks like to live faithfully for the sake of *our* comfort). As the English author and atheist [Julian Barnes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barnes) has written,

<blockquote>
There seems little point in a religion which is merely a weekly social event...as opposed to one which tells you exactly how to live, which colours and stains everything… What’s the point of faith unless you and it are serious – <em>seriously</em> serious – unless your religion fills, directs, stains and sustains your life?
</blockquote>

Indeed. Sometimes atheists know how to be better Christians than we do.
