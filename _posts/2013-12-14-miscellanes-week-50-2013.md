Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 265px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/serious_conversation2.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>08-14 December 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dlyC4D">A Unique Way to Memorize Scripture</a></strong> – Memorising portions of Scripture is (hopefully!) an aspiration for all Christians, and this looks like an interesting technique that could aid in that venture.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dlzG8C">How To Avoid Death-By-Eucharist</a></strong> – Here is a great post on the tendency to misread 1 Corinthians 11 and why the Eucharist shouldn't be all about sombre introspection, but about rejoicing in the new life we have in Christ.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/J2FUAJ">21 Reasons Why Exercising Is A Terrible Idea</a></strong> – For a touch of humour, I give you this, with a warning that you will fall off your chair laughing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gZ4ezr">4 reasons to cheer the Bible TV series on</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/krishk">Krish Kandiah</a> has a good post this week on the recent television series, <a href="http://www.channel5.com/shows/the-bible">The Bible</a>, and why we should take advantage of the opportunities this creates to introduce Scripture to people who have perhaps never read it before.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/19h1lZ2">Getting New Yorkers to Hear the Word</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city">This is Our City</a> conducted an interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/BethanyJenkins">Bethany Jenkins</a>, on her work with <a href="http://theparkforum.org">The Park Forum</a>, which exists to help Christian urban professionals stay engaged with the Bible every day as they seek the common good of their city. One of the reasons she started The Park Forum, she says, is because "it is dangerous to think about the 'common good' without first thinking about our own personal renewal."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1goKXtP">The Questions of Gay Marriage: How serious a concern is homosexuality?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/mattleeanderson">Matthew Anderson</a> offers a thoughtful piece this week on whether the fact that the Bible only has six verses on homosexuality means that the issue should only be a minor concern to us. He argues that we need to look beyond just these six verses, framing the whole question of sexuality in general with a proper understanding of Genesis 1-3, and the two theological loci of creation and redemption.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/l7yvSeVVPTc">Christmas in Dark Places</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/glenscrivener">Glen Scrivener</a> has put his poetic talent to work again with this great new video on what Christmas is all about.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Jedhk1">An Artful Conversation with Marilyn Chandler McEntyre</a></strong> – <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment"><em>Comment Magazine</em></a> online has a very interesting interview with <a href="http://www.westmont.edu/_academics/departments/english/dr-marilyn-chandler-mcentyre.html">Marilyn Chandler McEntyre</a> on learning to "converse with care." As someone who feels that our culture has largely lost the ability to have good conversation, I really enjoyed what she had to say.</li>
