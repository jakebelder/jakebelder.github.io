Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 253px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/change-the-world-sign.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>16-22 February 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1glgpVZ">Infographic: Top Ten Reasons for Choosing a Paper Book over an eBook</a></strong> – Most of the people who responded to this survey indicated that real books were preferable to e-books because of the feeling of real books and their ability to learn using real books. I resonate with that a lot.  And I simply just read better off of paper. There are far too many advantages to real books for me to ever switch to e-books.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/OexxFo">The Bible’s Vantage Point</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a> notes that some people read the Bible through the lens of "oppressed" and "oppressor", and see the Bible siding with the former. David quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesslie_Newbigin">Lesslie Newbigin</a>, who says that actually, "the shocking thing [about Jesus] was not that he sided with the poor against the rich but that he met everyone equally with the same unlimited mercy and the same unconditional demand for total loyalty.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1nShuaJ">Be Vulnerable. And Prepare to Have it Thrown Back at You</a></strong> – Pastors need to vulnerable, says <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager</a>, because your people need to know that you know you are a sinner, and that you are "in the same spiritual battle for holiness by grace that they [are] engaged in."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Nj9Tq4">On Banning 'Make A Difference'</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/drantbradley">Anthony Bradley</a> notes that young people have been pressured for too long to make a difference in the world, a phrase that burdens then with unrealistic (and usually undefined) expectations. Instead, we should just tell them to love God and love their neighbour. And I would add that, in the end, it is this kind of simple faithfulness that really makes a difference.</li>
