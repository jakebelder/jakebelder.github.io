Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 276px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Reading-a-book.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>03-09 November 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1b0JWSp">Bible in a year with the C of E</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">Anthony Smith</a> has put together this helpful post on how to use and understand the <a href="http://churchofengland.org">Church of England's</a> lectionary.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1b0Jvrn">Cowboys and Calvinists</a></strong> – This is an interesting article by the sociologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger">Peter Berger</a> on the so-called New Calvinism. He makes some particular observations about the influence of Calvinism in America, and notes as especially strange the influence it currently has amongst Southern Baptists.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1cE2VaD">Playing God: An Interview with Andy Crouch</a></strong> – The folks from <a href="http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation">The Washington Institute</a> have a great interview here with <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc">Andy Crouch</a>, talking about his new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830837655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0830837655&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power</a></em>. The second part of the interview can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/1cE3jWP">here</a>. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iRKahD">The obedience of reading</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/FaithTheology">Ben Myers</a> reflects here on the practice of reading, and the significance of what we're doing when we read. He says that to properly understand and appreciate what we're doing, we need to understand that 'the art of reading is an art of love.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iRLTn4">The End of Protestantism</a></strong> – The often-provocative <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> pushes all kinds of buttons again with this post, suggesting that those who identify as Protestants ought to instead consider themselves 'Reformational catholics'. While I resonate with a lot of what he says, there is also a lot that is questionable. But whatever you think, this is fuel for a good deal of conversation.</li>
