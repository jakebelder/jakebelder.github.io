If you are a sports fan, you may have already seen this. At the Atlanta Braves versus Toronto Blue Jays spring-training game last Friday in Kissimmee, Florida, Braves' second baseman, Dan Uggla, let go of his bat swinging for a pitch. [Mitch Davie caught the bat in mid-air](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/picturethis/2014421839_pt_batcatch.html) as it hurtled towards the stands, not even spilling a drop of his Red Stripe beer (notice, too, the near-perfect product placement). Some of the articles out there almost seem to debate which is the greater feat.

What you probably don't know is that Mitch is the manager at the Hertz location I work at. It's kind of cool to have your manager nominated on one site for [sports fan of the year](http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2011/03/introducing-mitch-davie-early-nominee-for-2011-sports-fan-of-the-year/). As a result, he's been getting all kinds of friend requests on Facebook, and he's been asked to do several radio interviews. The three guys to his right are other Hertz managers from this area, and I'm thinking they are probably glad he was there with them.

Dan Goldman, an Associated Press photographer, captured the incredible shot. You've got to love some of those facial expressions.
