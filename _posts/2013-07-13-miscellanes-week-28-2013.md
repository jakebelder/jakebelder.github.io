Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>07-13 July 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15a6pJN">Courage in the Ordinary</a></strong> – This is a brilliant article from a woman who spent time doing mission work in war-torn villages in Africa, but who now lives a comparatively 'ordinary' life back in America. She has come to understand that living a faithful, ordinary life is 'a lot more scary and a lot harder than being in a war-torn African village.' The article is a great encouragement to those who have trouble understanding how just living faithfully is actually pretty radical in and of itself. She writes, 'For those of us — and there are a lot of us — who are drawn to an edgy, sizzling spirituality, we need to embrace radical ordinariness and to be grounded in the challenge of the stable mundaneness of the well-lived Christian life.' Quoting a poster she once saw on a wall: 'Everyone wants a revolution. No one wants to do the dishes.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12qvT2v">Tim Keller on evangelism in the 21st century</a></strong> – Here is a really helpful ten-minute video from <a href="http://twitter.com/timkellernyc">Tim Keller</a> answering some questions about how to do evangelism in our communities and cities in the current context we live in, and offering some very useful practical suggestions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15j1K8p">The Importance of Being Vested</a></strong> – This article comes from a Lutheran perspective, and sets out to make a biblical and theological case that pastors should wear vestments as they lead in worship. I don't feel particularly strongly one way or the other on this issue, but I was intrigued to see that it <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jakebelder/posts/10151570007783883">sparked a fairly lively conversation on my Facebook wall</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15lxQQL">That Time C.S. Lewis Got ‘Total Depravity’ Wrong (Like Everybody Else)</a></strong> – A good post from <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> on how people so often misunderstand what 'total depravity' is really about. He helps clarify how the doctrine is meant to be understood, and offers a lesson on how we need to carefully read our favourite theologians.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18dd5wJ">Church interns: a new injustice</a></strong> – I found this article particularly interesting, especially because the role of ministry intern/apprentice/trainee is ubiquitous in the church circles in which I serve. The author makes the case that the current system of church internships is unjust and exploitative. I've not heard other interns speak like this before (although perhaps, as the author suggests, they're to afraid to speak out), so I'm really not sure what to make of this.</li>
