<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted here at the end of the week. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of October together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>October 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/744" target="_blank"><strong>On (not) choosing an Archbishop</strong></a> - The most recent news in the process of choosing the next Archbishop of Canterbury to take Rowan Williams' place was that the committee had reached an impasse. In this helpful article, Andrew Goddard explains why that's possible, and how the complicated process works.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2012/10/01/miracle-baby-is-home" target="_blank"><strong>Miracle Baby is home</strong></a> - If you follow me on Twitter or Facebook you might remember that my niece, the daughter of my brother and his wife, was born in July, eleven weeks premature, after my sister-in-law had some very serious complications. Earlier this week, their story was featured in their small town's local newspaper.</li>
<li><a href="http://antony-billington.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/the-global-study-bible.html" target="_blank"><strong>The Global Study Bible</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/ant_billington" target="_blank">Antony Billington</a> draws attention to a new version of the ESV study Bible that will have contributions authored by global church leaders. This looks like quite an interesting project, and is certainly an encouraging move.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/community-curator-how-artprize-is-changing-grand-rapids.html?paging=off&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;buffer_share=d2ebb" target="_blank"><strong>How ArtPrize Is Changing Grand Rapids</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> features an interesting article on a new annual public art competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the impact it is having on the city.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/9587430/Faithless-Britain-is-still-a-country-of-compassion-and-principles.html" target="_blank"><strong>Faithless Britain is still a country of compassion and principles</strong></a> - There was an interesting piece in The Telegraph earlier this week about the new kind of 'faith' emerging in Britain, replacing traditional Christianity. It focused specifically on Ed Milliband's understanding of faith, and stated, 'People are just    finding different ways of expressing and codifying what they believe, and    anyone who is interested in governing Britain needs to respond.' And this is important for the church to understand too as it ministers in this context.</li>
<li><a href="http://ministrynutsandbolts.com/2012/10/07/what-prayer-and-ministry-of-the-word-can-never-do/" target="_blank"><strong>What Prayer and Ministry of the Word can never do</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/Greenfarmhouse" target="_blank">Chris Green</a> blogs on a survey of what helps Christians grow the most in their faith. The answer? Personal Bible study.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/10/the-cultures-the-thing.php" target="_blank"><strong>The Culture's the Thing!</strong></a> - Here's a really interesting post by <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html" target="_blank">Carl Trueman</a> on the celebrity culture of the church. He notes, 'Just because somebody preaches the gospel, uses the name of Jesus  every other sentence and cries when they talk about the lost does not  guarantee that they are not a cult leader or simply in it for what they  can get out of it.' Particularly telling, he says, are the leadership structures in the church. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.credomag.com/the-magazine/archives/francis-schaeffer-at-100/" target="_blank"><strong>Francis Schaeffer at 100</strong></a> - There is a special issue of <em>Credo</em> magazine this month available as a PDF which looks at Schaeffer's thought and influence.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newcitycatechism.com/" target="_blank"><strong>New City Catechism</strong></a> - Here's a new project compiled by Tim Keller and Sam Shammas, and an effort to recover <a href="http://jakebelder.com/willimon-on-recovering-the-classical-shape-of" target="_blank">the practice of catechesis</a> in the church. Each of the fifty-two questions and answers has accompanying commentary and prayers. It really looks like a great project.</li>
<li><a href="http://artgoeswork.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Everyday heroes</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/Chemosynthesis" target="_blank">Christian Rosenlund</a>, a friend of mine from Finland and a talented photographer, and took these great shots of his brother, and another friend of mine, <a href="http://twitter.com/Dankku" target="_blank">Daniel</a>, at work one night last week.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.fieldnotesmagazine.com/donovan-richards/doctor-who/" target="_blank">Alone We Can Do So Little; Together We Can Do So Much</a></strong> - If you're a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>, you will find this post on what the show teaches us about relationships quite interesting.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/newyork/common-grace-of-central-park.html" target="_blank">Why Every City Needs a Central Park (and why more Christians are needed in urban planning)</a> </strong>- The <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> blog continues to be one of my favourite, and this week they had another great article on why public spaces like parks are so valuable to our cities. They also discuss the contributions Christians can make in this respect, especially in the way it opens up opportunities for fellowship with our neighbours, and the flourishing of our communities.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/jacobs/cold-comforts/" target="_blank"><strong>Cold Comforts</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/ayjay" target="_blank">Alan Jacobs</a> has a very intriguing post about how the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer.aspx" target="_blank">Book of Common Prayer</a> is still useful to people who no longer believe. He laments this 'old, and sad, story: the deep desire to hold on to whatever  vaporous comforts remain in religious rites or words after belief has  departed.'</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtoninst.org/2677/place-and-the-faithful-life/" target="_blank"><strong>Place and the Faithful Life</strong></a> - Over at <a href="http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation" target="_blank">The Washington Institute's</a> blog this week, they've had some great posts on what it means to live faithfully in urban, suburban, industrial, and rural contexts.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/10/a-cloud-the-size-of-mans-hand.php" target="_blank"><strong>A cloud the size of man's hand</strong></a> -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profiles/trueman.html" target="_blank">Carl Trueman</a> continues to hit the nail on the head as he critiques the growing celebrity culture in the evangelical church. He writes, 'When we are talking upper six and seven figure salaries for those  involved in ostensibly Christian work, when figures like ten grand per  lecture are bandied around and nobody seems to comment on it as  something distasteful or downright inappropriate, we are heading into  territory previously occupied by the televangelists and the prosperity  hucksters.' This has to stop. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/sanctification-debates-all-over-again/10/" target="_blank"><strong>Sanctification Debates All Over Again</strong></a> - Here are some interesting observations <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood</a> makes on what looks to be a tendency towards antinomianism within the New Calvinism. There are some helpful comments on the post as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/10/the-local-church/" target="_blank"><strong>The Local Church</strong></a> - Joel Willits has a short, but helpful post here on what defines and characterises the local church.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.unashamedworkman.org/articles/tim-kellers-five-questions-to-ask-any-bible-passage" target="_blank"><strong>Tim Keller&rsquo;s Five Questions To Ask Any Bible Passage</strong></a> - Colin Adams, otherwise known as the <a href="http://twitter.com/UnashamedWkman" target="_blank">Unashamed Workman</a>, posts a good list of questions from Tim Keller. I think they would be good questions to ask when preparing a sermon.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/le/2012/october-online-only/five-comments-preachers.html?paging=off" target="_blank"><strong>The Five Comments Preachers Hate Most</strong></a> - An interesting, and actually pretty accurate, list of remarks people often make after a sermon. It happens very rarely, but I do get particularly irked by number 3.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.zachicks.com/blog/2012/10/22/does-liturgy-work-with-the-poor-illiterate-or-uneducated.html" target="_blank">Does Liturgy Work with the Poor, Illiterate, or Uneducated?</a></strong> - This is a really interesting question. <a href="http://twitter.com/zachicks" target="_blank">Zac Hicks</a> interviews a pastor who say that it does, and talks about the good things he has seen in his congregation as a result. It strikes me as well that regularly hearing the language and grammar of a liturgy shapes how you think and speak about the world. And that is no bad thing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/october-web-only/are-pregnancies-even-from-rape-gift-from-god.html?paging=off&amp;buffer_share=62d63&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Are Pregnancies Even from Rape a Gift from God?</strong></a> - I recognise that there is a recent political situation surrounding this, but that aside, this is of course a massively painful and weighty issue. But in the question is a deeper question: can God's redemption touch even the most horrible of circumstances? </li>
<li><a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/what-is-evangelicalism-part-1/" target="_blank"><strong>What is Evangelicalism? &ndash; Part 1</strong></a> - There have been some discussions around the blogosphere recently about what exactly evangelicalism is (<a href="http://jakebelder.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-define-evangelicalism-35191" target="_blank">I raised the question myself last week</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts</a> contributes to the conversation here with some helpful thoughts. I hope he posts part 2 of his discussion soon.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kuyperiancommentary.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/how-to-celebrate-a-christian-halloween/" target="_blank">How to Celebrate a Christian Hallowe&rsquo;en</a></strong> - Hallowe'en is a day that always raises lots of discussion and debate amongst Christians about whether or not we should take part in it. This was quite an interesting post on the matter, although I felt that some of the conclusions were a bit of stretch.</li>
<li><a href="http://this-side-of-glory.com/articles/if-the-lds-took-a-red-pen-to-the-creed/" target="_blank"><strong>If the LDS took a red pen to the Creed</strong></a> - This is amusing, but it is also very helpful in coming to grips with where, and how significantly, Mormonism departs from orthodox Christianity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/10/happy-reformation-sunday/" target="_blank"><strong>Happy Reformation Sunday!</strong></a> - I rather enjoyed this post on the Reformation, mostly because of the quotation from Charles Spurgeon praising the preaching of a Catholic priest.</li>
<li><a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/three-books-by-dooyeweerd-recently.html" target="_blank"><strong>Three books by Herman Dooyeweerd recently (re)published</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebishopuk" target="_blank">Steve Bishop</a> links to three books by Dutch philosopher, <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/dooyeweerd.htm" target="_blank">Herman Dooyeweerd</a>, which have all been reprinted and are available for under &pound;10. I've ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0888152213/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0888152213&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Roots of Western Culture</em></a>, as it has been recommended to me on many occasions as one of the most accessible and helpful things Dooyeweerd has written.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2012/10/a-question-for-fiec.php" target="_blank"><strong>A question for FIEC?</strong></a> - Paul Levy, pastor of a Presbyterian church in London, raises the question of whether the <a href="http://www.fiec.org.uk/" target="_blank">Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches</a> could ever actually provide a home for those with paedo-baptist convictions, especially ministers.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/sandy-blows-in-and-romney-bows-out.html" target="_blank"><strong>Sandy blows in and Romney bows out</strong></a> - This is quite an interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Archbishop Cranmer</a> on the popular perception of Democrats and Republicans leading up to the American presidential election.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.john-stevens.com/2012/11/answering-paul-levy-where-are-all.html" target="_blank">Answering Paul Levy: Where Are All The Independent Paedo-Baptists?</a></strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/_JohnStevens" target="_blank">John Stevens</a>, director of the FIEC, responds to Paul Levy's post on baptism and the FIEC. It is quite an interesting response, and I may blog on it next week since it is an issue that hits close to home for me.</li>
