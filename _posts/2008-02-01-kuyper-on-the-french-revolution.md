This again is from Abraham Kuyper's 1891 speech, *The Problem of Poverty* (originally titled in Dutch, Sociale vraagstuk en de Christelijke religie). His analysis and comparing and contrasting of the social ideas of Christianity and the French Revolution are imbued with a sense of timelessness. What he says of the French Revolution may just as easily be said about the West today. And, of course, our prayer may be that what he says of Christianity may also remain true today.

<blockquote>
The French Revolution, against which every Christian who thinks consistently should turn, produced its evil not so much by throwing the Bourbons from the throne, nor my making the middle class more powerful than both the nobility and the clergy, but rather by completely changing people's consciousness and view of life.<br><br>

In the Christian religion, authority and freedom are bound together by the deeper principle that everything in creation is subject to God. The French Revolution threw out the majesty of the Lord in order to construct an artificial authority based on individual free will. That project resembled a scaffold nailed together from odd planks and beams which cracks and falls when the first gale rises. The Christian religion teaches us that life on earth is part of an external existence. The French Revolution, by contrast, denied and opposed everything beyond the horizon of this earthly life. The Christian religion speaks of a lost paradise, a state of purity from which we fell, and for that reason calls us to humility and conversion. The French Revolution saw in the state of nature the criterion of what is normally human, incited us to pride, and substituted the liberalizing of man's spirit for the need of conversion. Springing from God's love, the Christian religion brings loving compassion into the world. Over against that compassion, the French Revolution placed the egoism of a passionate struggle for possessions. And finally, to touch on the real point that lies at the heart of the social problem, the Christian religion seeks personal human dignity in the social relationships of an organically integrated society. The French Revolution disturbed that organic tissue, broke those social bonds, and left nothing but the monotonous, self-seeking individual asserting his own self-sufficiency (43-44).

I wonder what it would have been like to hear Kuyper speak. Captivating, I'm sure.
