<p>I found this in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.christiancentury.org">The Christian Century</a>, in a book review written by Mark Ralls.  On a side note, the article claims him to be the pastor of Epworth United Methodist Church in Concord, NC.  <a href="http://www.epworthnc.org/staff.htm">The church's website says otherwise.</a> Anyway, the book he reviews is <a href="http://www.veritas-ucsb.org/library/russell/home.html">Jeffrey Burton Russell's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Mislaid-Lost-Heaven-Regain/dp/0195160061/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-8376369-7838361?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1185389761&amp;sr=8-2">Paradise Mislaid: How We Lost Heaven---and How We Can Regain It</a>.  A part of Russell's book deals with postmodern apologetics, of which Ralls says:</p>
<blockquote>While modern apologists defend the citadel of belief against skeptical attacks, postmodern apologists have more modest aims.  They arrive on the scene after the walls have already come down and the fortress has crumbled.  Their task is archaeological.  They seek to gather what has been scattered, to recover what has been lost, and to piece these fragments of faith together into something that reveals their former coherence and beauty.</blockquote>

Thoughts on this analysis?
