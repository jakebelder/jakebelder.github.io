<p>One of the effects of the resurgence of Calvinism within evangelicalism, especially among the New Calvinists/Young, Restless, Reformed folk, is an increased recognition of the total depravity of humanity, which is one of the core doctrines of the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism#Five_points_of_Calvinism" target="_blank">five points of Calvinism</a>. It is affirmed that we, as the Heidelberg Catechism states pointedly, are so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined toward all evil (<a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_misery.cfm#QandA%208" target="_blank">Q&amp;A 8</a>). This, of course, is clear biblical teaching &ndash; one need look no farther than the picture Paul paints of humanity in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%203&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 3</a> to understand the depth of our sin.</p>

<p>This emphasis on total depravity has had a curious effect on the self-identity of those within this camp. For instance, you might come across the Twitter bio of a New Calvinist, who will boldly and proudly assert that he is a 'sinful wretch saved by grace'. For whatever reason, these sorts of self-loathing descriptors have  become very popular. Perhaps it is a way of magnifying the grace of God;  after all, part of becoming a Christian involves recognising our dire  need for redemption and our complete inability to save ourselves. Interestingly &ndash; and perhaps this is an observation to pick up another time &ndash; this mentality seems to engender a reverse sort of pride, where you compete to be known as the worst of sinners.</p>
<p>However, the assertion that you are a 'sinful wretch saved by grace' contains a glaring error, for the first half of the statement in the present tense is, according to Scripture, entirely irreconcilable with the second part in the past tense.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the Paul who gives these folks their 'sinful wretch' mentality from passages like Romans 3 is the same Paul who urges them to understand the radical transformation that takes place when the work of Christ is applied to them. Consider Romans 6:4: 'We were...buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.' Or Galatians 2:20: 'I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.' Or 2 Corinthians 5:17: 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' Or Galatians 3:26-27: 'You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.' Or Ephesians 2:4-5: 'But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions &ndash; it is by grace you have been saved.' And we could go on.</p>
<p>The point is simply that, because we have received grace, we are no longer 'sinful wretches'. That is why <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%203&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 3</a> precedes passages like <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%206&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 6</a>. At one point we were enemies of God, but because of our faith in Jesus Christ, that old person has been crucified with him and buried in the tomb. And when Christ was raised to new life, we were raised with him, thereby effecting a complete (although not yet fully realised) ontological change within us. Again, as Paul says, 'God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God' (2 Cor. 5:21). If this is true of you, then it should be unthinkable for you to continue identifying yourself as a 'sinful wretch'.</p>
<p>Many problems stem from the 'sinful wretch' mentality, but two stand out in particular. The first is how you understand your battle with sin. To adopt this sort of self-identification will easily lead you towards either antinomianism or legalism. On the one hand, understanding yourself to be a 'sinful wretch' dependent on God's grace leads to passivity in the ongoing battle against sin. It is not uncommon to hear people who adopt this perspective say that overcoming sin simply involves 'believing the gospel more'. Any suggestion that you actively work to fight against sin is met with caution, lest you begin <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/no-place-for-righteousness" target="_blank">relying on your own righteousness</a> instead of grace. You may have some understanding of justification, knowing that your sins are forgiven, but you entirely misunderstand the process of sanctification, thinking that you just sit back while the Spirit does all the work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, looking at yourself as a 'sinful wretch' might foster a legalistic view of the battle against sin. You may understand the application of grace as an assurance that your sins are forgiven, but nonetheless, you are still by nature a sinner who struggles to be righteous, relying on your own power to try to conform yourself to Christ's likeness. You will forever be working hard to try to attain a higher standard, and concerned about where you stand before God. Again, you may have some understanding of justification, but you entirely misunderstand the process of sanctification, thinking that you have to do all the work to make yourself righteous from that point forward.</p>
<p>Both perspectives are wrong, of course. This is not to say that we do not continue to battle sin &ndash; we do, after all, still live in a broken world where sin continues its ruthless assault on all that is good and where we will continue to be tempted to enslave ourselves to the powers of darkness &ndash; but we battle sin now as people who have been made righteous through the work of Christ. We must understand justification, that our sins are forgiven and that we are reconciled to God, but we also need a proper understanding of sanctification, recognising that through the power of the indwelling Spirit, we are enabled more and more to live in the light of our new identity as those who have been raised to new life with Christ. We can begin to live rightly because, as the Spirit works in our hearts and empowers us, we are able to fight and to overcome sin. The exhortations to holiness in Scripture (such as <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%206:11-14&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Rom. 6:11-14</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%208.9-17&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">8:9-17</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor%207.1&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">2 Cor. 7:1</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%204.17-5:20&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Eph 4:17-5:20</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%202.6-7&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Col. 2:6-7</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%203.1-4&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">3:1-4</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20pet%201.13-16&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">1 Pet. 1:13-16</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20pet%201.3-11&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">2 Pet. 1:3-11</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20john%203.1-6&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">1 John 3:1-6</a>) are not given to make us wallow in despair at our sinfulness, but to urge us on to live in the light of our new identity as children of God. We have been transformed, and we will continue to be even more transformed until that day when Christ returns and we are glorified, and we receive the fulness of our new life.</p>
<p>The second problem with the 'sinful wretch' mentality, and by far the biggest, is that it simply denies the effectiveness of the redemptive work of Christ. Jesus did not come to die so that 'sinful wretches' would remain 'sinful wretches', but he came to die so that we would become something else. God, through Christ, and by the power of the Spirit, has effected a total and complete change within us. We have been transformed. But when we fail to believe that, and when we fail to live in that reality, we effectively deny the gospel.</p>

So, stop the self-loathing. God loves you so much that he put your old self to death and raised you to new life with Christ, filling you with the Spirit so that you might embrace that new life and live for his praise and glory. Open the settings for your Twitter account, erase the bit that says 'sinful wretch', and replace it with 'new creation'. And rejoice in the new life you have in Christ.
