If you have read the first two books in [James K.A. Smith’s](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) ‘[Cultural Liturgies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVs0kW7QWU)’ series, *[Desiring the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035775/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035775&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, and *[Imagining the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035783&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, you will be familiar with his idea that we are fundamentally worshipping and desiring beings. You will also recall his observation that our culture is well aware of our natural orientation and intentionally uses different liturgical practices to shape those loves and desires in order that they might define who we are and how we ought to live. As I've mentioned before, [his illustration of the mall-as-temple beginning on page 19 of *Desiring the Kingdom*](http://www.thedivineconspiracy.org/Z5239S.pdf) makes this point very clearly.

I was watching a documentary on the BBC the other day called *[Das Auto](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2013/32/das-auto.html)*, and was surprised and intrigued when, part way through the programme, the presenters made the following observations about how BMW markets their cars. Again, if you've read Smith's books, this will jump out at you too.<br><br>

There are clear echoes here of what Smith is arguing in his books. As this short clip demonstrates, BMW know precisely what they are doing. They know that we are desiring beings, they know how worship shapes us, and they have capitalised on this understanding of human nature. If you were unconvinced by Smith’s thesis before, this is just a bit more evidence that he is exactly right.
