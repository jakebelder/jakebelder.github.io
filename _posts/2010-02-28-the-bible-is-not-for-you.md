<p>The doctrine of <em>sola Scriptura</em> has long been contentious, for any number of reasons. In the early American period, with a Christianity greatly influenced by populism and democratic ideals, it served as a license for people to interpret the Bible free of any traditional authorities such as ordained clergy and confessional standards. To put it bluntly, it gave them a license to do whatever they wanted. <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/president/">Nathan O. Hatch</a>, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Democratization-American-Christianity-Nathan-Hatch/dp/0300050607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264468733&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Democratization of American Christianity</em></a>, observes this:</p>
<blockquote>
Any number of denominations, sects, movements, and individuals between 1780 and 1830 claimed to be restoring a pristine biblical Christianity free from all human devices. 'In religious faith we have but one Father and one Master,' noted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalist_Church_of_America">Universalist</a> spokesman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_B._Grosh">A. B. Grosh</a>, 'and the Bible, the <em>Bible</em>, is our only acknowledged creed-book.' 'I have endeavored to read the scriptures as though no one had read them before me,' claimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_%28clergyman%29">Alexander Campbell</a>, 'and I am as much on my guard against reading them to-day, through the medium of my own views yesterrday, or a week ago, as I am against being influenced by any foreign name, authority, or system whatever.'<br><br>

Protestants from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_luther">Luther</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley">Wesley</a> had been forced to define carefully what they meant by <em>sola Scriptura</em>. They found it an effective banner to unfurl when attacking Catholics but always a bit troublesome when common people began to take the teaching seriously. For the Reformers, popular translations of the Bible did not imply that people were to understand the Scriptures apart from ministerial guidance. Thus when dealing with a scholar such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</a>, Luther could champion boldly the perspicuity of Scripture, its clarity for all: 'Who will maintain that the public fountain does not stand in the light, because some people in a back alley cannot see it, when everybody in the market place can see it quite plainly?' Yet when confronted with headstrong sectarians, he withdrew such democratic interpretations and admitted the danger of proving anything by Scripture: 'Now I learn that it suffices to throw many passages together helterskelter whether they fit or not. If this is the way to do it, I certainly shall prove with Scripture that Rastrum beer is better than Malmsey wine' (179-180).

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a> once wrote, in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aYYAAAAAMAAJ&amp;ots=_yH-7fOMXa&amp;dq=encyclopedia%20of%20sacred%20theology&amp;pg=PA564"><em>Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology</em></a>, that it would be foolish for someone to attempt to hike through the mountains of Switzerland <a href="http://jakebelder.blogspot.com/2009/06/kuyper-again-church-as-our-guide.html">without the help of a guide or a map</a>. That is analogous, of course, to saying neither is it wise for someone to take up the Bible and attempt to interpret it apart from the wisdom of the Church throughout the ages. "In its rich and many-sided life, extending across so many ages," Kuyper wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
the Church tells you at once what fallible interpretations you need no longer try, and what interpretation on the other hand offers you the best chances for success. On this ground the claim must be put, that the investigator of the Holy Scriptures shall take account of what history and the life of the Church teaches concerning the general points of view, from which to start his investigation, and which paths it is useless to further reconnoitre.
</blockquote>
<p>Kuyper's sentiments are entirely antithetical to most of American Christianity, both past and present. As much as democratic ideals have done good things for America as a political entity, insofar as people have allowed those ideals to shape the Church in America, they have done a great disservice. Like I said in my last post, God grants authority to the Church, not the individual. He gives Scripture to His <em>covenant people</em> that it may reveal their Lord and shape and govern their life according to His will. To be sure, the individual must appropriate Scripture for himself (Deut. 6:4-9; Psalm 119; 2 Tim. 3:16-17, etc.), but never in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Our identity as Christians is not primarily that we are individuals saved by Christ. This is true, but it is not primary. What is first is that God has called a <em>people</em> to Himself, has redeemed them and brought them into a covenant relationship with them. Individual believers constitute that people, but not atomistically; their corporate identity as the body of Christ is at the fore. It follows here, then, that our reading of Scripture is to be done <em>in</em> this covenant community and not apart from it. This is not to say individuals should not read their Bibles on their own, of course, but that when they do so they should read it through what Kuyper calls the "<a href="http://jakebelder.blogspot.com/2009/06/kuyper-again-church-as-our-guide.html">consciousness of the Church</a>." The Bible is, after all, God's covenant document with the Church.</p>
<p>When I was in college, <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm">Albert Wolters</a> once said something like, "Don't worry, you can't come up with any new heresies. They've all been tried already." I'm not sure if that was intended to comfort us, but the point was that if we set ourselves some theological boundaries and recognize that the Church throughout history has already tried a myriad of interpretations, approving some and disapproving others, we have ourselves a pretty reliable guide as we travel today.</p>

History matters, tradition matters, and the Church matters. They are gifts. Lean on them.
