<p>Recently, I came across something called <a href="http://colossianforum.org/">The Colossian Forum</a>, a new initiative to designed to facilitate conversations on the relationship of faith and science, especially for those who are preparing young students to go to university and out into the world. One of the people behind the project is <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/~jks4/bio.htm">James K.A. Smith</a>, professor of philosophy at <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/">Calvin College</a> in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p>What I find most encouraging about their work is that they are not attempting to hold one position above another, or to take sides on different points of contention, but they are giving people the tools to think about the often controversial relationship of faith and science and how Christ can be exalted as Lord in the midst of differences of opinions on this matter.</p>
<p>Here's an 8-minute clip in which members of the Forum talk a bit more about their work.</p>
