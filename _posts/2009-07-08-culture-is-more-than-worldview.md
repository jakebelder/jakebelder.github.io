In the last few days I have finally gotten around to reading <a href="http://www.culture-making.com/about/andy_crouch/">Andy Crouch's</a> award-winning book, <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830833943?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0830833943">Culture Making: Recovering our Creative Calling</a>.  Toward the end of the third chapter he addresses the topic of worldview, one I enjoy discussing, and points out that our calling as Christians in regards to culture goes beyond the abstract tendencies of worldview thinking:

<blockquote>
The language of worldview tends to imply, to paraphrase the Catholic writer Richard Rohr, that we can think ourselves into new ways of behaving.  But that is not the way culture works.  Culture helps us behave ourselves into new ways of thinking.  The risk in thinking 'worldviewishly' is that we will start to think that the best way to change culture is to analyze it.  We will start worldview academies, host worldview seminars, write worldview books.  These may have some real value if they help us understand the horizons that our culture shapes, but they cannot substitute for the creation of real cultural goods.  And they will subtly tend to produce philosophers rather than plumbers, abstract thinkers instead of artists and artisans. They can create a cultural niche in which 'worldview thinkers' are privileged while other kinds of culture makers are shunted aside.<br /><br />

But culture is not changed simply by thinking (64).
</blockquote>

For someone like myself who has a tendency toward this kind of abstract thinking, this is a key point.  It's not that worldview thinking is unimportant, but that it is only one part of our larger calling as Christians.  Culture making requires action.
