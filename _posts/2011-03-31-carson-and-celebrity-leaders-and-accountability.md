<p><a href="http://www.tiu.edu/divinity/academics/faculty/carson">Don Carson</a> spoke at the annual Yorkshire Evangelical Ministry Assembly back in February, and over the last couple of days I have been listening to the audio recordings of the sessions (which you can find on the <a href="http://www.ygp.org.uk/audio.asp">Yorkshire Gospel Partnership's website</a>). One thing he touched on I found particularly interesting, given some of the things I have been thinking about lately with regard to celebrity leaders in the church. Speaking on <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/2Ti3">2 Timothy 3</a>, he first discusses false teachers and says that they are easy to spot and, in a sense, not particularly harmful to the church. But, he goes on,</p>
<blockquote>
Far more serious is the kind of person who has been a Christian teacher, a revered Christian teacher, and then who gradually moves away from the center of the gospel. Just a little bit here, and a little bit there, and a little bit somewhere else, until someone begins to raise questions and says, "Uh, is that quite right? Does that actually square with the Bible?" And immediately there will be a lot of voices in unison saying, "Don't be so critical. Judge not lest you be judged! I mean, don't be so critical! He's been a great teacher. He's led many people to Christ, you know!" Then he moves a little farther away, and a little farther away, until he's actually teaching some things that are pretty blatantly untrue. But he's got such a reputation for piety and a heritage for godly teaching that many, many people don't see any danger, and if anybody raises a flag, then immediately they're hushed down because clearly they're being judgmental.
</blockquote>
<p>Carson notes two particularly important problems with celebrity culture in the church. The first, implicitly, is that celebrity leaders are not often held as accountable as other leaders (a point I made <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-cult-of-personality-and-the-church">last time I addressed this issue</a>). The second, related to this, is that when someone does try to hold a leader accountable, they are often attacked by the leader's followers. His remarks on this point are spot on. For the sake of example (and not at all to imply that they are the  type of leaders Carson is talking about here), just look at the fallout  when someone critiques a leader like John Piper or Mark Driscoll.</p>
<p>What is important to remember is that while it is good to have those we look up to for wisdom and knowledge, we cannot hold them in such high regard that they are beyond critique. Followers of celebrity leaders have a tendency to let discernment fall by the wayside, but it is not right to assume that their prominent position necessarily coincides with an unmatched standard of biblical fidelity. In fact, perhaps they need to be subjected to an even greater degree of accountability, because the demand of their position often exerts undue pressure on them to have opinions and responses about everything in short order, and to come up with a steady stream of profound and original insights.</p>

Leaders need to remain humble and be conscious of how easy it is to stray off the path without proper accountability, and their followers need to be much more willing to listen to critique of their leaders. Without this, the danger posed to the church is all too serious.
