Despite the nearly two months of inactivity on this blog, I have not given up on it and allowed it to die. It has simply been placed on the back burner due to some big changes in life. If you follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder), you know that earlier this year I was [selected to train for ordained ministry](https://twitter.com/jakebelder/status/467612027192897536) in the [Church of England](http://churchofengland.org), and so we have relocated to [Durham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham) where I'll be training at [Cranmer Hall](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/).

Moving and getting settled and all that comes along with that is not the time to be blogging, but now that we've been here for about a month, I expect to begin posting more regularly again soon. Look for some new stuff next week.
