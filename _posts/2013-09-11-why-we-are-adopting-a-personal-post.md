[Interstate 10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10) is an incredibly boring stretch of road, especially as you cross through northern Florida and into Alabama. As a result, there is not much to do while you drive except talk with the others in your car, which is what Robin and I did as we drove west towards Texas in May of 2011. Our conversation was focused particularly on the near future, as I had accepted the position at [the church I now serve](http://www.stjohnnewland.org.uk), and we were waiting for our visas to come so we could move to England.

One of things we talked about was children. By that point, we had been married for four years, and conversations about growing our family were becoming more frequent. I decided to bring up something I had been thinking about for a while: adoption. Not long before our road trip I had read an article about a couple who had decided to adopt as a first choice, and I had been quite moved by their story. I shared it with Robin as we drove, only to find out that she had been thinking a bit about adoption as well because a work colleague of hers had recently gone through the process of adopting a child.

Over the next while, we had regular conversations about whether or not it was something we should look into. We thought about it and prayed about it and shortly after we arrived in England, decided this was the step we wanted to take. The next step was to contact [Hull City Council](http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/adoption), and soon afterwards, the formal process began. That was a year and a half ago, and just this morning, we legally became the parents of two young boys. We have the privilege and joy of meeting them on Monday for the first time, and they will come home with us at the end of the month.

We frequently get asked why we chose to adopt, which is a perfectly reasonable question, and we thought that we would offer this post as an explanation to those who are interested to know the answer to that question.

The first reason is exactly the same reason people who have biological children choose to have children – we simply want to be parents. We want children.

In the past couple of years, we have also had an increasing burden for children in care, and an increasing awareness that we were able to do something very real and concrete to address this problem. Both of us had the blessing of growing up in very loving and stable homes, and we had begun to realise that there were so many children out there who did not have that same opportunity. Knowing that we could provide a loving and stable environment in which to raise children, and that we could make a very real difference in the lives of a few of these children in care, we wanted to act, and becoming adoptive parents was the best way for us to do so.

God’s people are also called to be concerned for justice, and there are frequent commands in the Bible for us to look after the poor and needy. Christians take up this call in all kinds of different ways, but we were drawn particularly to what James says our religion looks like in practice: 'To look after orphans…in their distress' (James 1:27). Pursuing justice in this way and seeking the flourishing of the children that we will raise is also a means for us to contribute in a small way towards seeking the peace and the prosperity of the city we have been called to (Jeremiah 29:7).

These are the main reasons we have decided to adopt. But Robin and I were also moved by the reality that we too have been adopted as God's children. God chose us to be 'adopted as his children through Jesus Christ' (Ephesians 1:5), and our confession that Jesus is Lord means that we have received his forgiveness and have been given new life, and brought into a new family, united with all those who confess the same. God has become our Father, and he has promised us that we will inherit all the blessings of his Kingdom as co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:14-17). Because adoption lies at the very core of who we are and is a central truth of the gospel, our adoption of these two boys means so much to us.

Thank you to all of you who have been praying for us over the past year and a half as we’ve gone through this process. We are especially grateful to our friends and family and our wonderful church family, who have shown us so much love and generous support as we have prepared for this. We continue to covet your prayers as we bring the boys home with us and begin life as a family.
