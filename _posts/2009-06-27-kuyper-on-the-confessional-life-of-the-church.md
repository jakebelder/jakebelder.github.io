<p>Yesterday I briefly mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a>, and wanted to post more from his discussion on the role of tradition and the Church's confessions.  As I mentioned, in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aYYAAAAAMAAJ&amp;ots=_yH-7fOMXa&amp;dq=encyclopedia%20of%20sacred%20theology&amp;pg=PA564"><span style="font-style: italic;">Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology: Its Principles</span></a>, he writes that in doing theology one should begin with the assumption that the Church is right (577). This idea is later drawn out further:</p>
<blockquote>
An objective condition lies in [the churchly confession]. It is a product of the life of the Church, as in the ever richer form it has revealed itself officially, i.e. in ecclesiastical assemblies, under the special guidance of the Holy Spirit.  Two things are contained in the confession.  First, the self-consciousness of the Church, as it has developed itself historically, which, consequently, is the result of a spiritual experience and a spiritual struggle that fills in the gap between the present and the first appearance of the Christian Church.  And in the second place, the result of the special leading of the Holy Spirit, vouchsafed in the course of ages to the Church, and to the knowledge of God that has developed itself within her pale.  For this reason the theologian should not undervalue the confession of his Church, as if in it a mere opinion presented itself to him over against which, with equal if not with better right, he might place <span style="font-style: italic;">his</span> opinion.  The life of the Church, and the forming and reforming of her self-consciousness, is an action which is uninterupptedly continued...That life pursues its own course, the stream of that life creates a bed for itself.  To the theologian, therefore, the confession of the Church does not merely possess the presumption of truth; it appears objectively before him clothed with authority; with that authority which the many wield over the individual, with the authority of the ages in the face of ephemeral excitements; with the authority of the office in distinction from personal life; and with the authority which is due to the churchly life by virtue of the guidance of the Holy Ghost.  It is not lawful, therefore, for him simply to slight this confessional life of the Church in order, while drifting on his own oars, to construct in his own way a new system of knowledge of God.  He who undertakes to do this is bound in the end to see his labor stricken with unfruitfulness, or he destroys the churchly life, whose welfare his study ought to further (591-592).
</blockquote>

Kuyper offers, I think, a great deal of wisdom with this insight.  It is certainly worth our time to consider these points.  I have one more post with another excerpt from this chapter on the docket.  Look for it in a day or two.
