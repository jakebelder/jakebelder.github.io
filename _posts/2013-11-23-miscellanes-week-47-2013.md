Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 244px; height: 325px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/leaving-church.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>17-23 November 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/185rPhP">12 Reasons Membership in a Local Church Matters</a></strong> – This is an interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> on the importance and significance of church membership. There are a lot of good points here.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1aDmQ5D">Biblical Catholicism: The Branch Theory</a></strong> – The question of what constitutes catholicity is a long- and oft-debated question, particularly between Protestants and Roman Catholics (not to mention the Eastern Orthodox). Here's an informative post both on the history of the question and an Anglican perspective on the matter.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18MfvNO">5 Things to Do Before Leaving Your Church</a></strong> – Leaving a church is often accompanied by bitterness and resentment, but it shouldn't be. Here is a very helpful post on how to leave a church without relational breakdown.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18MwQ9B">Evangelise or fossilise – John Sentamu's call for evangelism</a></strong> – The Archbishop of York, <a href="http://twitter.com/JohnSentamu">John Sentamu</a>, this week said, 'All people in Britain experience weather, and they talk about it readily and repeatedly. If only disciples of Jesus Christ in England did the same thing about Him.' He went on to emphasise the demise of churches that fail to carry out this mission.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18MxDak">What Classic, Orthodox Celibacy Isn’t</a></strong> – I've recently come across <a href="http://spiritualfriendship.org/">this blog</a>, of which <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> is a regular contributor, that focuses on rediscovering a full understanding of friendship that we have lost in the modern world, especially for those who, for the sake of faithfulness, must pursue a life of celibacy. In this helpful post, Wesley discusses our skewed ideas of singleness and why they are unhelpful to those who are single.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/19GtR1N">Explaining the Gospel? Baptism Should Help</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ugleyvicar">John Richardson</a> has a helpful post here on why baptism can be a helpful starting point for explaining the gospel. I've often wondered why evangelicals talk about baptism so infrequently if it is such a clear picture of the gospel.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18T4laj">The Second Vocational Reformation (2)</a></strong> – Following on from <a href="http://bit.ly/1aN8e2r">the first post</a> on the subject, <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a> has another encouraging post this week on the ongoing developments of a new vocational discipleship movement. There is still much to be done in the goal of getting people to understand that 'vocation is integral, not incidental, to the mission of God', but good things are increasingly happening.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18T5kXK">Do Church Leaders Really Have to be Missionaries?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a> posts some very thought-provoking questions a pastor friend of his asked about the role of a pastor in evangelism. There is definitely a conversation (or two or three) to be had here!</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1i1f8IQ">Is It Actually Hard to Be a Pastor?</a></strong> – This is a really helpful piece on how pastors think and talk about their work, and the impact that has on how parishioners understand and practice their vocations. We need to be careful about what we say because our approach to our vocation is in many ways a model to others, regardless of what they do.</li>
