<a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.com/">Steve Bishop</a> posted this clip on his blog last week, and I had to post it here as well because what Wright is saying is so important.  I especially appreciate his emphasis on viewing this as a pastoral matter.  Most of the talk I've been engaged in on this issue has occurred on more of a theological or philosophical level, but this truth is crucial for everyone to understand.

This ties back to a couple of things I said earlier on the subject of redemption.  In January, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/ridderbos-salvation-in-the-redemptive-histori">I posted a quote </a>from Herman Ridderbos' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Kingdom-Herman-N-Ribberbos/dp/0875524087/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231303583&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Coming of the Kingdom</span></a>, which I think especially brings to light a point that Wright is implicitly making here: redemption is not first about <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span>, but about <span style="font-style: italic;">God</span>.  That is to say, the focus of redemption is not about us as individual people going to be with God in some ethereal, spiritual existence.  Redemption is about God, the sovereign King, establishing His reign over His creation, bringing His people under His rule, and placing His blessing on them.

The distinction is between a dichotomous escapism that largely relegates God's sovereignty to a spiritual plane and couches salvation in purely individual terms, and a faith and worldview that recognizes Christ as Lord enthroned as the sovereign King over all of creation and which understands salvation as something cosmic and restorative extending as far as creation.  It is not ultimately about <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> getting saved.  Certainly that is part of it, but that needs to be understood in the context of the larger story, the story of God's redemptive plan enacted in history to bring all things under Him.
