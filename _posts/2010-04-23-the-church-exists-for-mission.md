<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Brunner">Emil Brunner</a> once made this incisive statement: "The church exists for mission as a fire exists in burning."</p>
<p>The doctrine of the church is   intimately  connected with the notion that Christianity is a  missionary religion. The two cannot be separated. Gary Badcock makes some significant observations regarding the mission of the church in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Where-God-Lives-Doctrine/dp/0802845827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270499593&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>The   House Where God Lives</em></a> (some of which I noted <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-mission-of-the-church-and-the-resurrectio">earlier</a>), and in the following paragraph, calls us to remember that mission is absolutely central to the church's identity, reflective of the insights of missiologists such as Lesslie Newbigin and David Bosch. This will be the last portion I take from his book for now, and so I leave the final word to him:</p>
<blockquote>
Much  of this biblical insight  [on the church's mission] is also present in  the doctrine of the  Trinity, according to which, through the sending of  the Son into the  world, and through the gift of the Spirit, the Father  shows himself to  be open to the creation, inviting it into his life.  The work of the Son  and the Spirit, the 'two hands of the Father'  (Irenaeus), reveals that  God takes a 'hands-on' approach to the world,  an approach that is  directed to our becoming 'participants of the  divine nature' (2 Pet.  1:4). This theme has had an impact on recent  missiological thought: it  appears in the concept of the <em>missio Dei </em>movement, which was developed  in the context of the ecumenical work of  the International Missionary Council in the mid-twentieth  century...According to one of the documents  issued in connection with  its <a href="http://www.oikoumene.org/en/who-are-we/organization-structure/consultative-bodies/world-mission-and-evangelism/history.html#c16566">1952 conference</a> in Willingen, Germany:<br><br>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The    mission is not only obedience to a word of the Lord, it is not only the   commitment to the gathering of the congregation; it is participation in   the sending of the Son, in the <em>missio Dei</em>, with the inclusive   aim of establishing the lordship of Christ over the whole redeemed   creation. The missionary movement of which we are a part has its source   in the Triune God Himself.</p><br>

According to this...view,  mission is not simply something the   church does, as it were, among its several other tasks and duties. Nor   would it be strictly accurate as a matter of theological principle to   say that the task of mission belongs to the church. Rather, since the   mission is fundamentally God's, and since the church merely participates   in it, the church belongs to the <em>missio Dei</em> rather than the <em>missio</em> to the church. Therefore, mission precedes the church and is utterly   fundamental: it is effectively the womb from which the church is called   into being. Or, to put it another way, it is only by virtue of the   church's participation in the divine mission that it actually comes into   existence. In this strictly theological sense, then, mission is  nothing  less than the source and content of all ecclesiology.
