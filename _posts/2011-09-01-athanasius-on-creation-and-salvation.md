From his seminal work, *[On the Incarnation of the Word](http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/history/ath-inc.htm)*, the great Church Father [Athanasius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_of_Alexandria) writes:

<blockquote>
We will begin, then, with the creation of the world and with God its maker, for the first fact that you must grasp is this: the renewal of creation has been wrought by the self-same Word, who made it in the beginning. There is thus no inconsistency between creation and salvation; for the Father has employed the same agent for both works, effecting the salvation of the world through the same Word who made it first.
</blockquote>

And all I add to that is a resounding, 'Amen!'
