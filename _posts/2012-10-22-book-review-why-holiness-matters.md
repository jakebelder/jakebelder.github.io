<p><a href="http://manofdepravity.com" target="_blank">Tyler Braun</a>, whom I've been connected with on <a href="http://twitter.com/tylerbraun" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and through blogging for a few years, has recently written a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/080240507X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=080240507X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Why Holiness Matters: We've Lost Our Way &ndash; But We Can Find it Again</em></a> (Chicago: Moody Press, 2012). He contacted me a few months ago and asked if I'd be interested in reviewing it for him, which I was happy to do (although I must apologise to him for taking so long to get to it!).</p>
<p>Tyler has addressed the book to the so-called 'millenials', a generation of people which include both him and myself, and he observes that they seem to have little concern for genuine holiness. He notes that we are happy to jump on the bandwagon of various causes and programs which champion things like justice or world peace, but when it comes to our own holiness, we do a good job of avoiding the issue.</p>
<p>The book begins by building a theological case for holiness, rooted in the holiness of God and our call to reflect that holiness. He suggests we need to understand and appreciate both God's holiness and his wrath against sin, the latter of which is especially controversial in our day, and something we are not in a hurry to talk about. But these two things are key to grasp as we move towards reflecting the image of Christ. We also need to recognise our sin and especially its power, because casual attitudes towards sin will not help us as we seek to grow in holiness. The path to holiness also involves grounding our identity in Christ and appreciating his great love for us.</p>
<p>Essential to all this is being rooted in a community committed to these things, in which we help each other pursue sanctification. As the community is shaped more and more after the holy God we serve, our holiness will also begin to shape our lives as individuals and communities out in the world.</p>
<p>Along with the commendable things about the book, I would also make a few observations on some the weaker points. Tyler addresses the book to millenials, but in doing so, we get the impression that the issue of holiness is something that only this generation struggles with. Additionally, he uses quite a few personal stories to illustrate his points which, while not problematic in and of itself, becomes so when he assumes that his experiences are shared by all millenials. He does not say that, of course, but at points it feels as if this is the implication.</p>
<p>I think his general argument could be tighter as well. The first third of the book is organised and structured quite well, but it seems to come apart a little after that. As he talks about holiness, Tyler wants to draw attention to some related issues, particularly in regard to what holiness looks like in practice, but in doing so, it ends up feeling like he is making various tangential remarks instead of tying all the different strands of thought together. Occasionally these thoughts reveal something akin to disillusionment with certain beliefs and practices in the more conservative (for lack of better term) camps of evangelicalism, which I think could be dealt with more constructively.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, Tyler's first book offers some good food for thought, and I know that many people will find it to be helpful and encouraging. And I certainly hope his call for us to pursue holiness does not go unheeded.</p>
