<p>Well, here we are on the first day of another new year, most of us shaking our heads wondering how 2010 &ndash; or even this whole decade &ndash; has gone by so quickly. And what's more, life's inherent unpredictability probably has many of us reflecting on how the past year has not been quite what we expected.</p>

<p>In my case, this is certainly true. We began the year with a lot of anticipation for what might be in store for us. I started the last semester of my seminary education, and soon&nbsp;afterwards&nbsp;began to look for an opening in a church so that I could move into a pastoral position once I finished school. The ball started rolling quickly, and before I knew it, I had graduated, flown to England to visit a couple of churches that were interested in me, and by the end of June <a href="http://jakebelder.com/some-news-about-our-future">had been offered a position</a> as an assistant minister at <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/">St John's Church</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull">Hull</a>. At that point, we thought that the end of 2010 was going to bring about the biggest change yet in our lives, and we certainly never expected to be be ringing another new year in Florida.</p>
<p>But here we are, waiting for visas to be sorted out. Ah, red tape.</p>
<p>To some degree, then, the last six months of 2010 have not been what we expected at all. Having thought we would be in England sometime in the fall, we anticipated working for a little while, shipping our stuff across the Atlantic, and making one last road trip to visit family and friends. Some of our stuff even sits in boxes behind me right now, evidence of what may have been a bit of overzealousness on our part once we found out we were moving.</p>
<p>Things have taken a different turn, however. Initially thinking I'd just work one temporary job in between graduating and moving, I'm on the third already, having worked at the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/RTSBookstore">bookstore</a> at the seminary (which I had to leave in August due to no longer being a student), spent about six weeks interning at <a href="http://www.thirdmill.org">Third Millennium Ministries</a>, and now <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=203019&amp;id=515663882&amp;l=410904f391">driving cars around</a> for Hertz.</p>
<p>August brought the most significant change on the job front, when the worship director at our church left and I moved into the role to fill in until they hired another one. I have lent my musical abilities to a number of worship teams over the years, but I have never imagined being the one in charge of it all. For one, I don't really sing all that well, especially as a lead singer. More importantly, though, I never felt that I was sufficiently gifted to undertake that role. Nonetheless, the church was happy to have me fill in, and they still have not found another worship director to take my place.</p>
<p>The first couple of months were exceedingly difficult. Week after week I felt like a complete failure, and the responsibilities of the position were stressing me out. Additionally, the part-time job with Hertz was quickly becoming full-time, as I routinely logged forty hours a week, leaving little time for the twenty hours a week that the preparation for Sunday's music required. Compounding this frustration was a feeling of guilt that I was not giving this role the attention it deserved.</p>
<p>In some respects, the feeling of failure has dissipated. To be sure, I still do not think that this is my forte and I still do not want to do this for a long time, but I have become more comfortable in the role. Part of the reason for this is that I work with a great worship team, who are both good musicians and eager participants. I occasionally find myself wanting to be adventurous with the music we use during worship, and every time they have stepped up to the challenge. For instance, during Advent I wrote an arrangement of 'Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence,' and was really unsure of how it was going to sound when I got them to play it. To my great delight, it ended up sounding far better than I imagined, all because they understood and felt what I was going for with the arrangement. I wish we had recorded it so you could hear it. Maybe someday.</p>
<p>Another reason I'm more comfortable in the role now is that I have been getting a lot of encouraging feedback from people in the congregation. It's not that I am yearning for praise from people &ndash; quite the opposite. Some have told me that they have been blessed by a greater diversity of music I have tried to use &ndash; I've had the pleasure of (re)introducing a number of rich psalms and hymns from the church's great treasure store &ndash; and because this has played a part in broadening their theological perspective. From a musical standpoint, I really do not care whether or not you want to use contemporary music; indeed, most of ours would fall into that category. But I've been quite dismayed by the poor lyrical content of much of the modern worship music and it has been of prime importance to me to ensure that the words we sing are biblically faithful and rich in substance.</p>
<p>Related to this, one of the ways I have benefited from being in this role is that it has given me the ability to do a lot of careful thinking about worship. The pastor at our church has been very helpful and encouraging in this regard, and I have enjoyed the opportunity to talk and work with him in shaping the worship here. &nbsp;I have also explored some of these thoughts in a few posts on worship a couple of months ago (see <a href="http://jakebelder.com/we-just-dont-know-how-to-feel-anymore">here</a>, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/god-initiates-we-respond-the-pattern-of-worsh">here</a>, and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/worship-as-the-cure-for-our-selfishness">here</a>), and I have worked hard to try to incorporate some of what I gleaned from those reflections into our worship. I'm not sure how I would measure my success on that front &ndash; or if I even should &ndash; but if people in our church feel like they come away from worship with a greater sense of the majesty and wonder of God, a greater love for him, and a desire to give him all the glory, then I guess we are doing something right.</p>
<p>In addition to the music, I've had several opportunities to preach this year. One of those sermons felt like a dismal failure, but another one felt incredibly energising and as I was preaching I felt that I could do this for the rest of my life. Although the past seven or eight years have seen me wrestling frequently with whether I wanted to pursue academics and get into teaching or go into pastoral ministry, I began this year with a firm conviction that at this point in my life I was being called to the church. Of course, I firmly believe that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/christian-scholars-as-public-intellectuals">the academy</a> should <a href="http://jakebelder.com/theology-is-for-the-church">serve the church</a>, but right now I feel called to serve as a pastor. And this is a conviction that continues to grow stronger, especially when I step into the pulpit (which I get to do again next Sunday when I preach on the first part of Nehemiah 4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, 2010 has, in large part, not been what we expected, but I suppose expectations are often not the same as reality. I cannot deny that the end of the year has been marked by some disappointment and questioning as we've struggled to understand why things haven't fallen into place yet for us to move to the UK. But we also look back and are beginning to realise that this has been something of a time of preparation for us. And despite the fact that we are not where we expected to be, we cannot help but rejoice in how good God has been to us, providing with so many things we are undeserving of, including a wonderful and loving church family who we feel we have grown so much closer to this year. On my part, I also thank God for the wonderful woman he has placed in my life, who I walk hand in hand with through every day, and who made the journey through 2010, regardless of circumstances, all the more incredible.</p>
<p>With 2011 ahead of us, I am not sure I want to think about expectations, though I know this is really quite inevitable. As much as I'd like to just to go on from here living day to day, the wandering power of the mind seems to overpower my will, and I find myself already hoping that the majority of 2011 will be spent in another country. Having had so much confirmation that this is the direction that God is leading us, we really want to go. We continue to hope and pray that this visa business will be sorted out soon, and we are so thankful that our new church family at St John's has been so exceedingly patient and encouraging throughout the process.</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot go without noting that, in large part, these reflections are selfish and short-sighted, for while I am here writing about how the year has not really been what I expected, my life has not been significantly altered by any of it. This is not the case for many around the world. I am sure that the people of Haiti never expected that their country would first be rocked by a massive earthquake and then hit with a horrendous cholera epidemic. I am sure that the thirty-three Chilean miners did not expect to be trapped 700 metres underground for 69 days. I am sure that the fishermen of the Gulf Coast did not plan on the Gulf of Mexico being covered with oil and seeing their livelihood essentially disappear. And I am sure that the people of Bangkok did not expect a military crackdown that left 91 dead and 2100 injured. I didn't lose a loved one, I didn't go hungry, and I had a roof over my head. Lots of others were not so fortunate.</p>
<p>So what do I really hope for in 2011? Ultimately, I hope that our Lord Jesus will return and fulfill his promise to make all things new, and to wipe away every tear. But until then, I hope and pray that the church will be bold and faithful in proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God, and making known to the world that true hope, comfort, and peace are found only in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

May 2011 be a year filled with many blessings for all of you.
