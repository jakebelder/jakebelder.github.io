Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 267px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/millennials.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>28 July-03 August 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16tCkFq">Anglican Nominalism As ‘Anglican Comprehensiveness’</a></strong> – This is written from an American context, making the observation that the idea of Anglican "comprehensiveness" has now simply come to mean "tolerant of anything but orthodoxy." What a sad state of affairs.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16vEIf0">#AskTK: Tim Keller's first Twitter Q&A</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/timkellernyc">Tim Keller</a> was on Twitter earlier this week responding to questions about theology and ministry. You can find all the tweets and his responses here, which are quite interesting. It's a unique way to do a Q&A.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1e6FqSH">Five Fundamental Questions Conservative Evangelicals Must Address</a></strong> – This is a thought-provoking piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/mattleeanderson">Matthew Anderson</a>, who observes that evangelicals need to learn to grapple with the questions that determine the plausibility of our witness in the midst of the challenges we face. He proposes some huge questions that are all worthy of many long conversations.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16vT532">Pro-Sacramental Reformation</a></strong> – Here is a really interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> on how the Reformers were actually <em>more</em> sacramental than the Roman Catholics. Why? Because "for the Reformers, <em>no one</em> was to participate in the life of Christ’s body <em>non</em>-sacramentally.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ccLmNo">Millennial Religion & the Sovereign Self</a></strong> – There has been a lot of talk of the millennial generation this week, thanks to a piece that <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/27/why-millennials-are-leaving-the-church/">appeared on CNN</a> purporting to speak on behalf of all millennials, letting the world know what this entire generation finds wrong with the church. Whilst the piece has its (many) flaws, <a href="https://twitter.com/ByzntnCalvnst">David Koyzis</a> offers a bit of a response to the desire of some millennials to hold only to their own religious authority, noting, "The way of the cross is always one of obedience. To come to the church with an idiosyncratic checklist of demands is to take the church as <em>church</em> less than fully seriously."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16H7BVy">The Low Churchman's Guide to the Solemn High Mass</a></strong> – The strapline of this website is, amusingly, "Keeping loyal Anglicans free from superstition since 2013." It describes various features of the ritualistic wing of Anglicanism and offers "warning signs" to those unfamiliar with Ritualism to help learn how to spot it and run away from it. If you're not a Ritualist, I would imagine you'll find this quite humorous.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16ICUzx">A Key Sign that You Are Maturing as a Preacher</a></strong> – You might be surprised to find that this article says it is all about the editing. A mature preacher knows what to leave <em>out</em> of a sermon, because they will know what their parishioners need most.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1efGxQ0">The emotionally and spiritually healthy pastor</a></strong> – Here is a helpful post from <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckdegroat">Chuck DeGroat</a> on why pastors need to learn to answer the question, "How are you?" honestly, drawing on examples from pastors in centuries past who were much more honest with people about their emotional and spiritual state. It is important to do this, he says, because pastors need to be cared for too. Quoting Dietrich Bonhoeffer: "Everyone who cares for the soul needs a person who will care for his or her own soul." And that begins with being open and honest about how you're doing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1efH5FB">Millennials & church: Why we need to question our questioning</a></strong> – Picking up the millennial theme again, here is an excellent post from <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> on why millennials, who are keen to ask lots of questions, need to both learn how to ask the right questions and be willing to be questioned themselves.</li>
