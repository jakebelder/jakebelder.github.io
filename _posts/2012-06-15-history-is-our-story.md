<p>Some Christians like to speak of history as '<em>His</em>-story', emphasizing the work of God in directing the course of history. This is true, of course, insofar as God's sovereignty is concerned. But, as <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/spykman.htm" target="_blank">Gordon Spykman</a> says in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802805256/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802805256" target="_blank"><em>Reformational Theology</em></a>, this could be potentially misleading, because it fails to do justice to the covenantal responsibility God has given to mankind:</p>
<blockquote>
As time and history are thus closely related, so too are history and culture. Culture refers to that which is historically significant, just as historical reflection dwells on that which is culturally formative. The history-making forces which shape culture involve the ongoing interaction between divine revelation and human response. Cultural history is therefore subservient to the sovereign Word of God. This overarching, normative reference point does not, however, lessen human accountability for the course of events in our life and in our world. Rather, it heightens it. Precisely because God is sovereign, we are the more responsible. It is therefore a basic misnomer, or at least potentially misleading, to speak of history as '<em>His</em>-story'. We may not that easily exonerate ourselves and indict God for the world's calamities. Creation is exclusively God's good work; that mixed blessing which we call culture is ours. Closer to the truth is therefore the affirmation that, under the sovereign rule of God's holding and healing Word, history is '<em>our</em> story'. We remain responsive recipients of revelation and responsible agents in using the time God gives us in shaping history and forming culture. History is accordingly the record of obedient and/or disobedient responses to the cultural mandate on the part of various human communities down through the ages (271).

<p>One of the things I have appreciated so much about Spykman's book is how he continually brings the covenant back into focus, recognising how essential it is for a proper understanding of God's dealings both with his world and with us. This covenantal understanding of history that Spykman presents helpfully serves to remind us, in line with what I've said recently, that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/how-the-covenant-of-creation-shapes-our-calli-46794" target="_blank">our calling as humans is to live <em>all</em> of our lives in faithfulness to our King</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm" target="_blank">Al Wolters</a>, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802829694/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802829694" target="_blank"><em>Creation Regained</em></a>, says that when we fail to understand this calling, to recognise that part of our role as human beings consists in the ongoing development of creation and culture, we instead look at cultural developments as "fundamentally alien to God's purposes in the world and will tend to brand them as being inherently 'secular'" (44). Concerned only with how Christ's redemption affects our souls, we are content to leave culture and society alone and let them unfold as they will.</p>
<p>This, however, is unfaithfulness to the calling God has given us. God's creation was always meant to be developed &ndash; the biblical story goes from a garden to a city, after all &ndash; and he intended his people to be the ones to develop it. Christians must take up the responsibility to bear witness to the rule of Christ over every area of culture and society, and to continually work at developing it further in faithfulness to him and in conformity with his creational laws and norms. This includes reclaiming those areas which, until now, have been left untouched by the transforming power of Christ's redemption.</p>

And this is why the story of history is <em>our</em> story. As history continues to unfold, may it be a story of our faithfulness to God and the responsibilities he has given to us.
