I received a reply from the priest of the [Orthodox Church in America](http://www.oca.org), to whom I sent an email regarding the issues I spoke of in my last post. Here I reproduce my question and his response:

<blockquote>
**Question:** A big theme in contemporary evangelicalism and Protestantism is to engage the culture that the Church finds itself in, discovering and implementing new ways of interpreting the truths of Scripture so that people of these new generations can access it, finding new ways of worshiping based on the cultural context the church is situated in, and remaining relevant so that its voice can be heard. This has become a particularly important focus recently as a perceived cultural shift has taken place, shifting us into a time of what some call postmodernism. I was wondering how the Orthodox Church responds to this. Does it acknowledge the existence of postmodernism, or a cultural shift? If so, how does it respond to this while remaining faithful to its teachings?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
**Answer:** That which you described is quite contrary to Orthodox Christian thought -- now, as well as during the Church's 2000 year history. While the Church certainly has adapted to a variety of cultures, it "christianizes" the culture, rather than allowing the culture to change, form, reform, etc. the Church.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Further, Orthodox Christianity is God centered, not man centered, as so much of "contemporary" American Protestantism tends to be. While the Church is indeed "seeker sensitive" in the sense that it embraces those who are seeking to worship and love God above all else, it is not "seeker sensitive" in the sense of offering things that have little or nothing to do with the Church's mission, that attempt to gratify the tastes and mores of the faithful. Such things as Christian exercise groups, "contemporary music" services, and the like have little to do with focusing on God, and become rather self-gratifying, consumer oriented gimmicks designed to attract a larger "market share" in the guise of proclaiming the Gospel.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Ultimately, the Gospel transcends time. While the Church attempts to adapt to the cultures in which it finds itself and to speak the language of these cultures, it does not change that which is essential in the sheer desire to increase "market share" among the unchurched, reverted, and lapsed, much less its own flock.
</blockquote>

There you have it. An interesting answer, and an interesting assessment of the Protestant Church. What do you think?
