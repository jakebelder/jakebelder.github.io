The publication of the 1549 *Book of Common Prayer* is one of the most significant moments in the history of the English Church. It was the first Protestant prayer book and the first attempt at reforming the worship of the Church after England’s ecclesiastical break with Rome. [Thomas Cranmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer) was given the task of creating an English liturgy for the people that would help shape their worship and belief as England wrestled through the changes of the Reformation era.

I read [the preface to the 1549 edition](http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/front_matter_1549.htm) last week for a module I’m currently enrolled in on issues of authority in Anglicanism, and a number of things struck me. In the first place was Cranmer’s insistence that worship was for the purpose of growing in godliness. This appears a few times throughout the preface (which is only a couple of pages): The ‘common prayers in the Church…[are] for a great advancement in godliness’; ‘The whole Bible should be read over once every year’ so that everyone ‘should (by often reading and meditation in God’s Word) be stirred up to godliness’; and so on.

Cranmer notes that the trappings and ceremonies that had been introduced in centuries prior to the Reformation hindered people from becoming more godly because worship became so completely inaccessible to them. Whether it was the fact that the Mass was conducted in Latin, that so little Scripture was read, or that good things were distorted and ‘grew daily to more and more abuses’, Cranmer was firm in his conviction that ‘because they have much blinded the people and obscured the glory of God, [they] are worthy to be cut away and clean rejected’. He even goes so far as to poke a bit of fun at the difficulties of just trying to follow Roman worship:

<blockquote>
The number and hardness of the rules called the <em>Pie</em>, and the manifold changings of the service, was the cause that to turn the book only was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was more business to find out what should be read than to read it when it was found out.
</blockquote>

Thus the prayer book was introduced as a means of simplifying the worship of the English Church. It is important to note that Cranmer was not inventing anything new. This was truly an act of *reform*: to take things that had been passed down from the Early Church, to strip them of whatever had distorted them in more recent centuries, and to give back to the Church something that would once again form them into the likeness of Christ. That is why amongst the changes Cranmer made was to renew the emphasis on the primacy of Scripture. In his famous phrase, he wanted Christians to '[hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them'](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/collects-epistles-and-gospels/the-second-sunday-in-advent.aspx), and so he completely saturated the worship of the Church with Scripture, both by having nearly the whole Bible read through every year in the context of gathered worship, and by infusing the language of the liturgy itself with Scripture.

Finally, Cranmer states something about the unifying purpose of the new prayer book, and in doing so, says something significant about the whole question of comprehensiveness and bringing a diverse church together by means of a common form of worship:

<blockquote>
In this our time the minds of men are so diverse that some think it is a great matter of conscience to depart from a piece of the least of their ceremonies, they be so addicted to their old customs; and again on the other side, some be so new-fangled that they would innovate all things and so despise the old that nothing can like them, but that is new; it was thought expedient, not so much to have respect how to please and satisfy either of these parties, as how to please God and profit them both.
</blockquote>

That last line is incredibly significant. Cranmer wanted to see the English Church united, but he was not willing to let that merely be a surface or superficial unity (like we, in many ways, [unfortunately seem to have today](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/anglicans-need-to-start-doing-theology)). For him, that unity had to be expressed in true commonality of worship (the extent of that commonality is an important question, of course), and even more, in the shared goal of glorifying God and of growing in holiness.

We would do well if our unity was based on those same goals today. Does that mean a return to the *Book of Common Prayer*? No, but perhaps it is worth thinking about whether something like *Common Worship*, [in all its vastness and diversity](http://www.morganstudio.co.uk/project/common_worship/selected), actually maintains the commonality of worship Cranmer called for, or whether it is intended more 'to please and satisfy...parties' rather than 'to please God and profit them'.<sup>1</sup>
