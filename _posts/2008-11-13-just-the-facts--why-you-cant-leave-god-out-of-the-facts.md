<p>Recently, I finished reading the first volume in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Scott_Latourette">Kenneth Scott Latourette's</a> heptalogy, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Expansion-Christianity-Set/dp/B0015Z5LD0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226521751&amp;sr=1-1">A History of the Expansion of Christianity</a></em>. In the introductory chapter to the series, he says this:</p>

<blockquote>
Among the chief limitations [in composing a history such as this] must be the writer's own presuppositions. The author is not conscious of any thesis which he desires to establish. He has set himself to the objective investigation of the facts and has been eager to see them as they actually are and to hear and to record what they have to say.
</blockquote>

<p>The book was difficult to read. I found a lot of what Latourette said to be contentious&mdash;not in the facts he presented, but the manner in which he presented them. His intention of being so overtly objective caused me to shut the book in frustration several times in the middle of reading it. Latourette was a professor at Yale for quite some time and also spent a number of years in China as a Baptist missionary. That he was a committed Christian is certain, and it is that factor in specific that perhaps makes his attempts at objectivity even more problematic.</p>
<p>As a scholarly work, his survey of the first five-hundred years of Christianity in this first volume does quite a good job of comprehensively looking at the relevant factors that contributed to the growth of Christianity, its intellectual and practical development, and the influence it exerted on the environment in which it existed&mdash;save but one critical factor: he never once makes any mention of the role of the Spirit in the growth and development of Christianity. He explains,</p>

<blockquote>
The author has been trained in the school of modern history which looks askance at the supernatural and sees in the flow of events simply mechanical and human factors&mdash;geographical, climatic, economic, political, social, aesthetic, and intellectual. Most members of this school decline to affirm any cosmic significance in human history. If in the story of the human race they discern any determining cause or causes (and many of them are unable to do so) they find them in some factor or combination of factors which by themselves cannot be labeled as 'supernatural.' Usually they seek causes, but believe them to be only in preceding events, in human nature, and in the physical environment. It is from this standpoint that these volumes are written.
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that Latourette makes a grave error writing from this standpoint, for two reasons. First, he actually <em>fails</em> to be objective and ignores one of the tasks of the historian&mdash;to accurately report the facts of history&mdash;and therefore is not entirely honest and truthful. Second, and of far greater importance, he explicitly neglects his calling to be a faithful witness to Jesus Christ. While he acknowledges in the following paragraph to the one quoted above that some points in the story of human history are inexplicable without the concession that God is active in ordering history, he nevertheless states that where this is the case, he has refrained from discussing the matter.<a href="http://jakebelder.com/staying-focused-as-history-unfolds"></a></p>
<p>I've said before that history is only properly conceived of as being fundamentally <span style="font-style: italic;">His</span>-story, the story of God's sovereign plan unfolding throughout history. If we do not make this foundation our starting point we fail to understand history properly. The task of the Christian historian is not some sort of neutral statement of facts. Latourette's statement that he had no thesis to establish was misguided. His thesis should have been that God is at work in history to direct it to His glory and to His end.</p>

God is the beginning and the end of all the facts of history. The Christian historian has a very important apologetic task in this regard as well to make known the wondrous deeds of God in history so that the world may know Him. It is absolutely impossible for history to be recounted&mdash;especially the history of the bride of Christ!&mdash;from any other perspective.
