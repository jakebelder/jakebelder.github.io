If you have wondered at all why I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a> so much, read this small portion from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Certainty-Faith-Herman-Bavinck/dp/0888150814"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Certainty of Faith</span></a>:

<blockquote>
[W]e must remind ourselves that the Catholic righteousness by good works is vastly preferable to a Protestant righteousness by good doctrine. At least righteousness by good works benefits one&rsquo;s neighbor, whereas righteousness by good doctrine only produces lovelessness and pride. Furthermore, we must not blind ourselves to the tremendous faith, genuine repentance, complete surrender and the fervent love for God and neighbor evident in the lives and work of many Catholic Christians. The Christian life is so rich that it develops its full glory not just in a single form or within the walls of one church.
</blockquote>

Enough said.
