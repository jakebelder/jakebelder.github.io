[Pete Ward](https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=13451) is a practical theologian whose recent work explores the intersection of ecclesiology and ethnography. His contention, as articulated in the introduction to the edited collection, *[Perspectives on Ecclesiology and Ethnography](http://amzn.to/1H0p9lY)*, is that ethnography can make a significant contribution to the discussion of the church because of the ‘growing sense that there is often a disconnection between what we say doctrinally about the church and the experience of life in a local parish’ (4). Ethnography, Ward argues, gives us the tools to explore the practical and lived ecclesiology at work in a local context, in distinction from a purely theoretical and dogmatic ecclesiology. He continues:

<blockquote>
It has been the custom in theological circles to talk about social realities in ways that lack credibility. It is interesting to contrast the way we theologians customarily talk about the contemporary church with the way we deal with historical or philosophical sources. When it comes to history or philosophy, we proceed with considerable caution. We take great care to make sure that we abide by accepted academic convention and we want to demonstrate that we are proceeding with academic rigour. Then when we talk about the contemporary church, completely different rules seem to apply. It becomes acceptable to make assertions where there is no evidence. We assume a common perception of contemporary church life between author and reader. We base whole arguments on anecdote and the selective treatment of experience… The turn to ethnography challenges these conventions by the simple observation that assertions about the lived reality of the church require a kind of discipline and rigour similar to those that pertain to other areas of theological writing (4).
</blockquote>

For Ward, this is a question of plausibility. Allowing ethnography to contribute to the work of ecclesiology serves to encourage ‘a way of talking about the church that is closer to or at least more directly concerned with congregational life’ (5). Not giving due attention to what is actually happening in the life of the church limits the scope of ecclesiology. Instead, Ward suggests, 'ecclesiology needs ethnography', because when our concentrated explorations of the lived reality of the church intersect with our normative judgements and dogmatic assertions, the latter are ‘enhanced and finessed’ (6).

I think Ward makes an important point in encouraging us to attend to the reality of the church on the ground. But that of course raises big questions, not least about the extent to which ethnography should shape ecclesiology. Should the findings of ethnographic research be given primacy and be allowed to re-shape and re-define ecclesiology? Or does ethnography instead help to show us where the lived reality of the church needs to challenged and brought in line with what Scripture says about the church?

These are some of the questions the contributors to the volume address. And as they come from a wide range of perspectives, it certainly makes for interesting reading.
