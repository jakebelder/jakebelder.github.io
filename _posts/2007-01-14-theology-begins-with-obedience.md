<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a> once defined theology as knowing God.  It's a simple definition, yet it has significant implications.  In his recent book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Salvation Belongs to the Lord</span>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frame">John M. Frame </a>discusses what it means to take this definition literally.  Expanding on Kuyper's definition, Frame says, "If you say that theology is knowing God, you make it a personal activity rather than a merely academic one.  Knowing God is something more than knowing <span style="font-style: italic;">about</span> God" (73, emphasis mine).

Frame states that to begin to know God, we need to know Him as Lord---that is, we acknowledge His sovereignty over everything.  This is perhaps the defining characteristic of Reformed/Calvinist theology.  When we begin with this as our foundation, our knowledge comes to us in a different manner than a merely empirical pursuit.  Knowledge that begins with the acknowledgment of God as Lord means that our knowledge begins with obedience.  1 John 2:3-4 gives clear indication of this: "We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands."

Putting it very succinctly, Frame says, "If you want to know whether someone knows God, look at his or her life" (76).  It's that simple.  And it is not to be any different for someone who studies theology on a much more academic level than someone else.  You can exegete the original languages, study commentaries, philosophize about things, and use whatever other academic tools are at your fingertips, but it means nothing if the love and obedience of God are not first and foremost.  Theologians have a calling, and they need to do theology for the sake of the people.  Hear Frame again:</p>

<blockquote>
Theology is the <span style="font-style: italic;">application</span> of the Word by persons to the world and to all areas of human life.  We need theology not because there is something wrong with the Bible, an improper form perhaps, but because there is something wrong with us.  The Bible is fine, just as it is.  The problem is that we are slow to grasp it, both because of our weakness and because of our sin.  So the theologian, like a good preacher, takes the biblical text and explains it to us" (79-80).
</blockquote>

Theological knowledge is not something to puff ourselves up over (cf. 1 Corinthians 8:1) but rather it is to be used to bring us closer to God---both theologians and those they minister to.  It's a simple beginning.  Knowing God begins with obeying God.
