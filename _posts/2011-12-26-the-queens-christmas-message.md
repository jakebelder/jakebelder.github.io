<p>With this being our first Christmas in Britain, we had the opportunity to take part in the Christmas tradition of gathering around the television at 3pm to watch <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16328899">the Queen's Christmas address</a>. What everyone is talking about after this year's address &ndash; and what the media is avoiding talking about &ndash; is the last part of her speech, where she spoke of the forgiveness of sins that comes through Jesus Christ and her prayer that all would make room in their heart for him.</p>

<p>The various reactions triggered by this are interesting. As I mentioned above, I saw several news reports this morning reviewing the speech, none of which mentioned the last part. But on Twitter and Facebook, I've seen many Christians overflowing with excitement that their Queen would point so clearly to Christ as the hope of the world. While the message itself excites them, of course, the excitement is probably more a result of such a prominent public figure so openly talking about Jesus.</p>
<p>What makes the Queen's speech interesting as well is how it contrasts with a recent speech by Prime Minister David Cameron on<a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/king-james-bible/"> the place of Christianity in Britain</a> &ndash; she insisting that salvation is found through faith in Jesus, he merely pointing to the role Christianity's values and morals play in shaping British society and his own rather minimal commitment to it.</p>
<p>When I lead the 8:00am service at our church, I sometimes get to pray these words from the Book of Common Prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">Almighty and everlasting God...we humbly beseech thee so to dispose and govern the heart of Elizabeth thy servant, our Queen and Governour, that, in all her thoughts, words, and works, she may ever seek thy honour and glory, and study to preserve thy people committed to her charge, in wealth, peace, and godliness.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having heard her speech, I am glad to know a little more about the faith of the Queen we pray for each week. And we will keep offering these prayers for her, trusting that God will continue to guide and sustain her.</p>

God save the Queen.
