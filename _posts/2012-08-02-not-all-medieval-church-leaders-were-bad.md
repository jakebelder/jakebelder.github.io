<p>In the study of church history, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_history_of_Christianity#High_Middle_Ages_.28800.E2.80.931300.29" target="_blank">the medieval era</a>, many Protestants are quick to vilify all those who were a part of the establishment. The church at the time was, of course, notoriously corrupt, and many of the Popes, Cardinals, and bishops were entirely caught up in the corruption and were primarily concerned with their own selfish gain. But it is entirely unfair to assume that all religious leaders of the time were of the same ilk.</p>

<p>Last evening, we began <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/news.asp?id=58" target="_blank">a short summer series in place of our usual home groups and central prayer meetings</a>, looking at a few of the major figures in church history leading up to and including the Reformation era. Last night we looked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_wycliffe" target="_blank">John Wycliffe</a>, who was tried a number of times for heresy, particularly by the then Bishop of London and later Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Courtenay" target="_blank">William Courtenay</a>.</p>
<p>We often look at these heresy trials and immediately assume that they are a farce, simply a way for the establishment to keep all the peasants and ordinary people in line. In some cases, again, that was true. After all, quashing anyone who steps out of line is the key to retaining power. But last night it was suggested that men like Courtenay actually had a legitimate concern for heresy; that is, they thought that Wycliffe and his followers were really and truly in danger of hell because of what they perceived to be false teachings.</p>
<p>The point is simply that we need to approach history with graciousness. Yes, the medieval church was in dire need of reformation, and was in many ways thoroughly unbiblical. Yes, men like Wycliffe played a major role in stirring up that reformation and reclaiming biblical and theological perspectives that had been lost. But it is important to remember that men on both sides had good intentions &ndash; some in the establishment were genuinely concerned for the preservation of unity and what they understood to be truth. Just as true, men on both sides had bad intentions &ndash; not all Protestants were solely motivated by a concern for the authority of Scripture and the glory of God.</p>
<p>Without this understanding, we so easily fall into the twin traps of vilifying those who are not part of our tradition, and romanticising those who are. This kind of historiography does no one any good for it does not deal honestly with history. We fail to gain a holistic understanding of the whole picture, and as a result, our perspectives are skewed. We end up rallying around an understanding of a particular figure or tradition that is not entirely accurate, which in turn puts us at odds with those of other traditions. Before long, we begin to consider them to be our enemies. This is neither gracious nor fair.</p>
<p>Our parents teach us that honesty is the best policy, and that is equally true in the study of history. The traditions we hold to and consider to be biblical are not without their flaws. Understanding this, as well as recognising the good intentions of those in other traditions, will help to keep us humble. The pursuit of unity in the gospel can only produce fruit when we start with a posture of humility.</p>

I trust the implications for our debates and discussions in the church today are obvious.
