<p>In my first year of seminary, I was assigned a paper in which I essentially had to think about the idea of sacred space from a biblical standpoint and determine, more specifically, if this had any bearing on the architecture of church buildings. I found it to be a very interesting and challenging assignment, and though I came to no firm conclusion on the matter, I still find myself thinking about it often.</p>

<p>Recently, I finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.T._Wright">N.T. Wright's</a> excellent book, <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5528/nm/Surprised+by+Hope%3A+Rethinking+Heaven,+the+Resurrection,+and+the+Mission+of+the+Church+%28Hardcover%29?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners"><em>Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church</em></a>. Wright, an outspoken champion of biblical idea that redemption extends as far as the curse is found &ndash; in contrast to many Christians who view redemption as something spiritualised and otherworldly &ndash; helpfully guides the reader through a discussion of what this holistic redemption means for space, time, and matter. Wright says the following about how the redemption of space might give us pause to think about our church buildings:</p>
<blockquote>
The renewal and reclaiming of <em>space</em> has recently involved, among other things, a fresh grasp of the Celtic tradition of 'thin places,' places where the curtain between heaven and earth seems almost transparent. This is in fact just one aspect of a much wider theology of place, which has been under serious threat in the West since the Enlightenment. We urgently need to recapture this theology before, to use an obvious metaphor, all the ancient trees are cut down to make room for a shopping centre and parking lot just when people are starting to realise how much shade those trees provide in summer, how much fruit they bear in autumn, and how beautiful they look in spring. Jesus does indeed declare that God calls all people everywhere to worship him in spirit and truth rather than limiting worship to this or that holy mountain. But this doesn't undercut a proper theology of God's reclaiming of the whole world, which is anticipated in the claiming of space for worship and prayer. Church buildings and other places...<em>are not a retreat from the world but a bridgehead into the world</em>, a way of claiming part of God-given space for his glory, against the day when the whole world will thrill to his praise.<br><br>

It is nothing short of dualistic folly, then, simply to declare without ado...that old church buildings and the like are irrelevant to the mission of God today and tomorrow... Many are rediscovering in our day that there are indeed such things as places sanctified by long usage for prayer and worship, places where, often without being able to explain it, people of all sorts find that prayer is more natural, that God can be known and felt more readily. We should reflect long and hard on a proper theology of place and space, thought through in terms of God's promise to renew the whole creation, before we abandon geography and territory.
</blockquote>

Very interesting.
