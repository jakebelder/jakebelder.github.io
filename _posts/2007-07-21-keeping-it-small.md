I think there's wisdom in this. It's from Frederica Mathewes-Green's book, *Facing East: A Pilgrim's Journey into the Mysteries of Orthodoxy*. In the added postscript to the 2006 edition of the book, she talks about the growth her church in Maryland has undergone:

<blockquote>
On a typical Sunday the church is as full as it can comfortably be, and while we gladly go up to uncomfortable levels for major feasts and weddings, there's talk of starting a new mission to the south. The stone-walled church can't be expanded, and moving to a larger building is not desirable; why get fatter when you can reproduce? Orthodoxy works best when a priest knowns his parishioners well and can give them personal spiritual direction and visit in their homes a few times a year. A 'mega-church' wouldn't do it. It's better to start another congregation and launch a new community on its way (242).
</blockquote>

Just as applicable to Protestants, I would think, and definitely a notion I find myself in agreement with.
