<p>There are a number of great cities in Canada, and the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al">Montr&eacute;al</a> is perhaps one of the most unique.  I have not spent a great deal of time there, but the few times I have been I have really enjoyed it.  If you are ever planning to visit Canada, be sure that one of the places you visit is Montr&eacute;al.  The video to your left here is a short two-minute clip, uniquely made, giving you a short taste of the city.</p>
<p>Montr&eacute;al is quite possibly the most culturally-unique city in Canada.  Its location and history have created a culture with multiple influences.  There is an old joke in Qu&eacute;bec that says, "We could have had French          culture, British government and American know-how... but what we've really          got is American culture, French government and British know-how!" Some have gone so far as to call Montr&eacute;al "Amerope," as it is shaped by a very distinct blend of American and European culture.</p>
<p>Aside from making this an interesting city to visit, it creates a distinct challenge for church planting efforts in one of the least-churched cities in North America.  The <a href="http://www.redeemer2.com/rcpc/index.cfm">Redeemer Urban Church Planting Center</a> has been putting out an <a href="http://www.redeemer2.com/rcpc/index.cfm?fuseaction=blueprint">e-newsletter</a> for a few years now, and back in 2004 they <a href="http://www.redeemer2.com/themovement/issues/2004/april/amerope_observations.html">featured one of the church planting efforts in Montr&eacute;al</a>.  Here's what they had to say about the unique challenges in that city:</p>

<blockquote>
So, what makes Montr&eacute;al unique? Well, first of all, Montr&eacute;al is bilingual, boasting the second largest French-speaking population in the world. Culturally, it reflects the American life and attitudes. In addition to being geographically located in North America, Montr&eacute;alers and Americans share an increasing consumer mentality where choice is imperative. Montr&eacute;alers also value the ease and spontaneity commonly associated with Americans.<br /><br />

But Montr&eacute;al is more influenced by European intellectual and social values than other Canadian cities. Like Europeans, Montr&eacute;alers are less forthcoming than Americans and see a difference between 'friends' and 'acquaintances.' They are a bit more clannish and more cautious about allowing people into their lives. Typically, for church planters, this means that it takes longer for people to really open up and become a 'friend.'<br /><br />

In addition to these differences is Montr&eacute;al's particular spiritual history. In the past, it has been heavily influenced by Roman Catholicism, which today is widely rejected and viewed as being authoritarian, intellectually confining and too ritualistic. French existentialism has also influenced the thinking of those leading the social values of Montr&eacute;al. But today, this philosophy too is increasingly questioned. The gate-keepers are beginning to understand that they need consensus and community in order to build a society. Similar to the trend in Europe, Montr&eacute;al is moving toward a softer humanism where unity, cooperation and community are paramount. All these things make Montr&eacute;al a uniquely diverse challenge for those living the Gospel in Montr&eacute;al.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/">On the Square</a>, the online blog of <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">First Things</span></a>, featured <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/?p=1272">a very interesting article</a> on this changing cultural climate in Qu&eacute;bec a few weeks ago written by <a href="http://theology.concordia.ca/faculty/allen.php">Paul Allen</a>, professor of theology at Concordia University in Montr&eacute;al.  Allen noted that upcoming generations are disillusioned by the cultural values and expressions of earlier generations and are looking for something more.  He concluded by saying, "what we hear is a lament for culture, a dissent, a reflection on Qu&eacute;bec&rsquo;s roots, a felt desire for something solid, permanent, and life-giving."</p>

That blows the door wide open for the Church to enter through.  Church planting efforts will most certainly be a great challenge here, but when a culture is in flux as it seems to be in Montr&eacute;al and in Qu&eacute;bec, it creates a unique opportunity for the Church to renew its presence in the city to play a major role in transforming that culture.  Would it be a challenge you would consider taking up?
