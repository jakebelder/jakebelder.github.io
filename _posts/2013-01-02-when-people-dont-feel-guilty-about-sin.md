<p><a href="http://www.tsm.edu/faculty_profiles/dr_wesley_hill" target="_blank">Wesley Hill</a>, assistant professor of biblical studies at <a href="http://www.tsm.edu/" target="_blank">Trinity School for Ministry</a>, had an interesting article in <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/" target="_blank"><em>First Things</em></a> a few weeks ago <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2012/12/bonhoefferrsquos-argument-against-religious-blackmail" target="_blank">about confusing the distinction between sin and feeling guilty</a>. Citing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer" target="_blank">Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a>, he argues that Christians too often engage in evangelism and apologetics without appreciating this distinction, and find ourselves in this situation:</p>
<blockquote>
Too often we Christians are heard as saying something along the following lines: 'Your life of casual sex (or cohabitation, or homosexuality) surely must be leading you to feel empty, unfulfilled, and jaded. But we have the solution for those unpleasant feelings!' To which the reply is often: 'I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint, but I don&rsquo;t feel excessively guilty or ashamed or unfulfilled. On the contrary, my gay partnership has given me more emotional peace than I&rsquo;ve ever had.'<br><br>
In other words, we Christians are often found making [this] mistake: in our rush to defend our understanding of sin and human flourishing, we too easily assume that the same emotions must be the universal human result of certain behavioral choices. When those expected emotions aren&rsquo;t present&mdash;when Paul, for instance, feels no guilt after persecuting the early Christians&mdash;we&rsquo;re suddenly left wondering what went wrong with our doctrine of sin.
</blockquote>
<p>As a preacher, I know I have sometimes failed to appreciate this distinction, and so I find this quite helpful. Hill's (and Bonhoeffer's) point is that we don't need to try and dig beneath the surface to find someone's hidden feeling of guilt or insecurity and grab on to that in order to convince them of their need for a Saviour. We must simply proclaim Christ as Lord and the totality of his claim on a person's life, and in doing so, demonstrating the objective reality of sin. Hill writes, 'Regardless of what a person may <em>feel</em>, Bonhoeffer implies, the gospel truly addresses them and lays claim to their lives. The truths of sin and redemption aren&rsquo;t dependent on the rising and falling of human emotional states.'</p>
