<p><a href="http://www.langhampartnership.org/chris-wright/">Chris Wright</a>, a leading missiologist and International Director for the <a href="http://www.langhampartnership.org/">Langham Partnership International</a>, gave this excellent talk at the <a href="http://www.lausanne.org/cape-town-2010">Third Lausanne Congress in Cape Town</a> this week. The blurb on the <a href="http://conversation.lausanne.org/en/conversations/detail/11556">website</a> says, "[Wright] challenges the people of God to confront the idols of power and pride, popularity and success, and wealth and greed. He calls the Church to repentance and simplicity." You must find 23 minutes to watch this.</p>
