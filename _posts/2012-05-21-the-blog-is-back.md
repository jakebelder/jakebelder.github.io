After a four-month hiatus, I have decided to it is time to resume blogging again. The break has been good and productive, and now I'm ready to get back to regular writing. I will continue to do the weekly <a href="http://jakebelder.com/tag/miscellan%C3%A9es"><em>Miscellan&eacute;es</em></a> series I began during the break, but those posts will move to Saturday (as you will have noticed with the most recent in the series), and will now be combined with the sort of regular blogging I was doing before I took a hiatus. But as bloggers tend to do &ndash; wisely, I think &ndash; I make no promises about the regularity of posting.

If you've hung on during the break, I appreciate it, and look forward to your contributions to the forthcoming conversations. The first new post will be up later today.
