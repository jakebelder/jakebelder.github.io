If you spend any amount of time with Anglicans from the [Church of England](http://churchofengland.org), you will soon find yourself in a discussion about the costs and benefits of being an established Church. I exaggerate, of course, but have certainly been surprised at how often this issue does come up in conversation. There are an interesting mix of opinions on the matter within the Church of England, and I get the sense that discontentment with the current status quo is on the rise. It will be interesting to see how or if things change in coming years.

Personally, I have not had reason to give much thought to the issue before moving to England, and only recently have begun to think through the various arguments for and against establishment. One of the most interesting arguments I have come across in favour of establishment is one I encountered recently when reading [Martin Davie's](http://mbarrattdavie.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/reflections-of-an-anglican-theologian-2/) book, *[A Guide to the Church of England](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1906286132/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1906286132&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. He writes,

<blockquote>
A further response, which is made by some (although not all) of the supporters of establishment, is to say that the recognition offered to Christianity by the state through the establishment of the Church of England is appropriate not simply because Christianity is the historical religion of this country or because most people would still identify themselves as being Christian in some way, but because Jesus Christ is the full and final revelation of God and eternal life is received only through Him. As Anglican theologians such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hooker">Hooker</a> have argued, it follows that a state that truly wishes to promote the welfare of its people will give its support for the Christian religion to be proclaimed and promoted so that its truth is publicly acknowledged and people come to faith and baptism (68).
</blockquote>

There are lots of other arguments to consider, of course, but there is some 'common good' thinking going on here, a commitment to the flourishing of all people. And that's an idea I can get on board with.
