Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>13-19 April 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jHlPxR">Why Resurrection People Remember the Dead</a></strong> – This is a great post on the hope we have in Jesus of death's final defeat: "Practices like [visiting the grave of a loved one and remembering them] are not simply a salve for individual grief. Rather, they help us corporately align ourselves with God's battle against death, Satan, and sin. They reach into the past, embrace the memory of the dead, and rush forward in hope for a day when we are united with the historic community of faith in renewed bodies at the final resurrection. As often as we proclaim the Lord's death and sing the word <em>Maranatha</em> in church, we join with heaven's protest against death's grip on all creation and cultivate a longing for God's victory to be complete."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jHoMyz">Evidence for the Resurrection</a></strong> – Every year around this time, posts on the historicity of the resurrection appear online. This year, <a href="http://twitter.com/Psephizo">Ian Paul</a> has put together a helpful post on the subject.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eEsQ3O">Churches “Pandering” to Millennials?</a></strong> – A good post on why changing the message of Christianity to attract the attention of especially younger people never works, but what we do need to think about is what it looks like to hold on to the gospel while meeting people where they're at.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iYCwTB">More Muslims May Be Coming To Christ in Iran Than Anywhere Else</a></strong> – These kinds of reports are always very interesting and encouraging. This article notes, with echoes of <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/works/apologeticum.htm">Tertullian</a>, "According to Open Doors the harsh treatment of Christians by the regime is only fueling the flames of church growth."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1nqpkJT">The Gospel of Jesus' Wife: Not Just For Breakfast Anymore</a></strong> – You may have heard all the recent stuff about a new papyrus fragment that says Jesus had a wife, and I guarantee you won't find a better response to it than this one from <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a>.</li>
