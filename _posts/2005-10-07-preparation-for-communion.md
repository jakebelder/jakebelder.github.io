In my Papal Encyclicals class last night, we were discussing the connection of penance and the Eucharist in Roman Catholic thought. The two are very tightly connected, as one must make penance before participating in the Eucharist. This is, of course, based on a Biblical notion--the apostle Paul speaks of the necessity of preparing yourself and seeking forgiveness for your sins before partaking of the Supper.

The discussion turned towards how the sacrament is viewed within Calvinist circles. Probably a little over half of the students in the class come from that background, be it Dutch Reformed or Presbyterian of some sort. In this tradition, the Lord's Supper is celebrated far less frequently than the Roman Catholic Mass, which is several times a week, if not every day at larger churches. Most churches have set calender dates for observing communion, be it four, six, maybe eight times a year. Others may do it once a month, but you won't find many Reformed churches that do it more often than this.

Lately I've begun to think that the Lord's Supper should be taken more often--in fact, I would have no problem doing it every week, as John Calvin wanted in the church in Geneva. I think there's a problem with the way Reformed churches have it so infrequently. It seems to me that it would lead to more of an apathetic view of faith. If the Supper is only observed six times a year, you are only admonished to make careful preparation the week before. I'm not in any way suggesting that this is the attitude of all people within Calvinist circles. But many have observed that there is a very slight tendency towards apathy and nominalism within Reformed churches. Is this infrequent celebration of communion a factor in fostering that?

For this reason, I think an increase in partaking of the sacrament is a good thing. Obviously, celebrating communion is a very good thing, because not only does it allow us to lay aside our differences as believers and meet together to partake in the body and blood of our one and only Savior, Jesus Christ, but it gives us time to reflect on what He accomplished for us on the cross. By doing this, it should spur us to make every effort possible to live for Him every minute of every day. We shouldn't need to make a note on the calender of the week that we need to remember this and prepare for it, it should be an ongoing thing.
