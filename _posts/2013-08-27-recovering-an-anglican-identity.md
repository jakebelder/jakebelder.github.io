Last week, the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Justin Welby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Welby), likened the Anglican Communion to '[a drunk man walking near the edge of a cliff](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10257459/On-the-edge-of-a-precipice-Welbys-doomsday-warning-to-feuding-Church.html)', ready to fall over the edge of the precipice at any moment. He was, of course, referring to the ever-widening divide between liberals and orthodox Anglicans around the world. In response to how to heal this growing rift, some urge increasing compromise on all sides in order to keep the Communion together, while many others recognise that the fabric will continue to be torn until a real, biblical and confessional unity is recovered, one that goes well beyond mere institutional unity.

Kevin Kallsen and George Conger, the hosts of the weekly YouTube newscast, [Anglican Unscripted](http://anglican.tv/youtube-keywords/anglican-unscripted), addressed Welby's comments in the first ten minutes of the most recent episode, and made some poignant remarks on the problem:<br><br>

Now, I know people have different opinions about the [GAFCON](http://gafcon.org/) movement, but even if you ignore their comments regarding that, they are exactly right about the lack of an Anglican identity and the need to recover an identity rooted in biblical orthodoxy. George's final observation that some people love the institution more than the Lord is perceptive, and this reality has contributed significantly to the erosion of Anglican identity.

But it is also an acute warning that must no longer go unheeded. If the Anglican Communion does not want to continue on as a drunk man on the edge of a precipice, the way forward is clear. Jesus' words to the church in Ephesus are words that many Anglicans need to hear: 'You have forsaken the love you had at first. Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first' (Revelation 2:4-5).
