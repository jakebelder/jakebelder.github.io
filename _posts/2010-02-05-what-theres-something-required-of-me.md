<p>Yes, dear church-goer, there certainly is. From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Larger_Catechism">Westminster Larger Catechism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Q. 160: <em>What is required of those that hear the Word preached?</em><br><br>

A. It is required of those that hear the Word preached, that they attend upon it with diligence, preparation, and prayer; examine what they hear by the Scriptures; receive the truth with faith, love, meekness, and readiness of mind, as the Word of God; meditate, and confer of it; hide it in their hearts, and bring forth the fruit of it in their lives.
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of flies in the face of that whole, "Here we are now, entertain us!" mentality of American evangelicalism, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Do forgive the cynicism. In reality, yes, this is a significant responsibility given to those who hear the preaching of the Word. But it is also one that comes with great blessing. Think of the words of Psalm 1: "Blessed is the man...[whose] delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither." That's a powerful image. And the corresponding negative is powerful too&mdash;without meditating on the Word we essentially become dead trees in an arid land, barely holding on, if at all.</p>

Go read Psalm 119. It is telling that David's longest Psalm is about his love for God's Word. Oh, that we would sing praises like that for the Word of our Lord!
