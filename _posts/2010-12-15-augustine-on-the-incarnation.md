Few can express the wonder of the incarnation like [St Augustine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) can:

<blockquote>
He, through whom time was made, was made in time; and He, older by eternity than the world itself, was younger in age than many of His servants in the world; He, who made man, was made man; He was given existence by a mother whom He brought into existence; He was carried in hands which He formed; He nursed at breasts which He filled; He cried like a babe in the manger in speechless infancyâ€”this Word without which human eloquence is speechless!
</blockquote>
