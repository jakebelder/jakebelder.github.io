<p>In an introductory philosophy course in college I had to read <a href="http://www.washingtoninst.org/about/bios.asp">Steven Garber's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Faithfulness-Weaving-Together-Behavior/dp/0830833196/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229657897&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fabric of Faithfulness</span><em>: Weaving Together Belief and Behavior During the University Years</em></a>.  The basic premise of his book is that the college years are some of the most formative years in a person's life and it is in this setting that students begin to think about many big questions, going through a process of forming convictions about the nature of reality and the purpose of life.  They must deal with a simple, yet significant question: <span style="font-style: italic;">Why do you get up in the morning?</span></p>
<p>What makes this process of worldview formation so complex is that the university, culture, and dominating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist"><span style="font-style: italic;">zeitgeist</span></a> provide a type of atmosphere that makes it very difficult for a Christian student to explore these questions.  For this reason, Garber argues that it is critical for Christian students to have mentors, those who have coherent and biblical worldviews and who faithfully live out of those convictions. In these critical years, Garber says, it is essential that students do three things:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>develop a worldview that can make sense of life, facing the challenge of truth and coherence in an increasingly pluralist world;</li>
<li>pursue a relationship with a teacher whose life incarnates the worldview the student is learning to embrace;</li>
<li>commit themselves to others who have chosen to live their lives embedded in that same worldview, journeying together in truth after the vision of a coherent and meaningful life (171).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, it is not as simple as a three-step program, but these suggestions form a starting point from which the student can begin "to understand the world that God has made and our place in it."  The college years can be an intensely difficult period of intellectual turmoil if students are not equipped to walk that road.  This is where the community becomes so important, because "for a student to truly understand the content of his convictions he must see them lived...students need to see their worldview incarnated in the lives of their teachers if it is to be grasped in a way that can make sense of life for life."  Garber then concludes that for students to decide which commitments will give shape and substance to life they must put on</p>

<blockquote>
bifocal lenses&mdash;developing a worldview, set alongside the history of ideas; being drawn into relationship with a teacher who incarnates that worldview, set alongside the ethic of character; seeing one's worldview embedded in a community of character, set alongside the sociology of knowledge&mdash;[lenses which] provide depth and breadth as we continue to ask and answer [these big questions] (173).</blockquote>

Students in the Christian community are, like the young man of Proverbs, continually exhorted to seek true wisdom.  During this crucial time in their lives it is our calling as teachers, mentors, and fellow believers to point them to and incarnate the wisdom of Scripture as they seek to find their place in God's story and live faithfully as His children in this world.
