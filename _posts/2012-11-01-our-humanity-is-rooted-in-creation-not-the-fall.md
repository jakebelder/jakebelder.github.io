<p>Earlier this week I posted about the importance of <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/you-are-not-a-sinful-wretch" target="_blank">rooting our identity in the new life we have in Christ</a>,  noting the increasing tendency in some circles to conceive of ourselves  as 'sinful wretches' even after the redemptive work of Christ has been  applied to us. In response, <a href="https://twitter.com/rgrydns" target="_blank">Richard Greydanus</a>, who I went to university with, suggested that this mentality stems from <a href="https://twitter.com/rgrydns/status/263608907019206656" target="_blank">getting lost in the dialectic of sin and redemption</a>. He hits on an important point, because our anthropology gets distorted when we fail to root it in the doctrine of creation.</p>

<p>When  we view ourselves as fundamentally sinful beings, we see redemption as  only addressing our sinfulness. While this is certainly a key part of  the work of Christ (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%201.21&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Matt. 1:21</a>), it severely limits the scope of salvation. Redemption is about reclaiming and  restoring the original goodness of creation (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%208.20-21&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Rom. 8:20-21</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201.19-20&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Col.  1:19-20</a>), including our humanity.</p>
<p>When God created human beings, he made them in his image, and  established them as the pinnacle of his creation. He intended us to rule  over that creation as his vice-regents, bearing witness to his cosmic  rule as Lord and King (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201.28&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Gen. 1:28</a>). Submitting to his Lordship and living  righteous and holy lives is fundamental to who we are as humans. The  fall into sin meant that we rejected God's rule and forsook our  calling. However, it is at this point that the doctrine of creation  becomes so crucial, because sin does not have mastery over creation. Sin  is a parasite that attaches itself to God's good creation at every  point and seeks to distort and ruin it, but it cannot undo what God has  called good. It can mask it, it can obscure it, but it cannot undo it.  As I said last time, sin has so distorted humanity that we are, apart  from Christ, unable to do any good on our own. But this cannot be the  starting point of our anthropology, because sin only masks and  distorts the fundamental and original goodness of our humanity. When  we allow it to define us, then our understanding of redemption is  limited solely to the removal of sin, and ends up obscuring our  humanity. The gospel becomes limited to justification by faith.</p>

Our anthropology must begin with creation if we are to properly understand how we has humans are redeemed. Redemption, as I said above, is about reclaiming and  restoring the original goodness of creation, and this is no less true  for God's redemption of his people. Christ not only deals with the  problem of sin, but makes us a new creation, <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/redemption-enables-us-to-keep-being-human" target="_blank">beginning the work of restoring us to our full humanity</a>.  As he does so, we once again become people <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/how-the-covenant-of-creation-shapes-our-calling" target="_blank">who can take up our calling</a> to rule over creation, and who can, as we are progressively sanctified,  more and more bear faithful witness to the Lordship of Jesus Christ in  every area of life.
