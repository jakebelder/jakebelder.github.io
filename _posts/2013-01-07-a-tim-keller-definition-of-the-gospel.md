<p>I titled this post the way I did because I'm sure <a href="http://timothykeller.com/author/" target="_blank">Tim Keller</a> has defined the  gospel in multiple different ways over the years, but I quite like this definition, which comes from his recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1444702599/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1444702599" target="_blank"><em>Every Good Endeavour</em></a>. It does a good job of encapsulating the whole of the biblical story:</p>
<blockquote>
The gospel is the true story that God made a good world that was marred by sin and evil, but through Jesus Christ he redeemed it at infinite cost to himself, so that someday he will return to renew all creation; end all suffering and death; and restore absolute peace, justice, and joy in the world forever.
</blockquote>
<p>There is certainly a clear echo here of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck" target="_blank">Herman Bavinck's</a> statement on the essence of Christianity, from the first volume of his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035767/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035767" target="_blank"><em>Reformed Dogmatics</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The essence of the Christian religion consists in the reality that the creation of the Father, ruined by sin, is restored in the death of the Son of God, and re-created by the grace of the Spirit into a kingdom of God.
</blockquote>

Keller and Bavinck both understand the full scope of the redemption that comes through Christ, and rightly declare that the gospel is good news for the whole of creation.
