<p>I noticed on Facebook yesterday that a number of my friends had posted this as their status:</p>
<blockquote>
A boy writes a letter to God: 'Dear God, why do you let bad things happen in our schools?' God replies, 'Dear Son, I'm not allowed in your schools.'
</blockquote>
<p>The line of argument is clear &ndash; since God is no longer 'allowed' in the public school system, a judgement of some sort has been pronounced upon the public school system such that 'bad things' continue to happen.</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 260px;"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/school-prayer.jpg" /></div>
<p>A few things should stand out immediately here. In the first place, there are two major theological errors at work. It is implied, for one, that the bad things that are happening in the schools are outside of God's control. The bad things happen because God is no longer present in the schools. The second error, then, is related to the first &ndash; God is no longer present in the schools since he is not acknowledged or welcomed. So, there is a denial of God's sovereignty in directing history, and his omnipresence.</p>
<p>In the second place, this is classic American civil religion at work. The widespread belief among evangelicals in the United States is that God is judging their nation because the broader culture no longer acknowledges and worships him. This is a big deal particularly because of the pervasive belief that in some sense, America is a sort of promised land entrusted with a mission from God to be a light to the rest of the world. For years now, especially since the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial">Scopes Trial</a> of 1925, Christians in the US have felt that the schools have been a prime battleground for what <a href="http://jamesdavisonhunter.com/">James Davison Hunter</a> has coined the 'culture wars'. Years of fighting over all kinds of issues &ndash; prayer in the schools, teaching evolution versus creationism &ndash; have created a strong perception of victimisation. Broader culture and liberal social elites are on a mission to&nbsp;suppress&nbsp;Christianity. And so the 'bad things' happening in the schools is judgement finally being rendered on those who have opposed the presence of Christianity in cultural institutions like schools.</p>
<p>One of the things that continues to confuse me most about this country is the expectation that Christianity should be given a prominent place in American culture. In a nation where freedom of religion and separation of church and state are constantly heralded as good things, why should anyone expect that <em>public</em>&nbsp;schools be of one particular religious tradition? Public schools function as educational institutions for everyone in society at large. To be sure, the schools are not <em>irreligious</em>&nbsp;&ndash; after all, all of life is religion &ndash; but unless this was a Christian theocracy of sorts, the public schools are under no obligation to be overtly Christian (or Muslim, or Buddhist, or Taoist, for that matter).</p>
<p>For reasons I cannot understand, there continues to be a widespread confidence among American Christians that the political process can solve all of their problems. Civil religion maintains that so long as people will acknowledge God, the country will be a better place &ndash; increased prosperity, more churches on street corners, stores closed on Sundays, less R-rated movies coming out of Hollywood, and so on. And the primary way for this to be achieved is by systematically legislating morality, such as demanding that each school day open with prayer and that evolution be stricken from the science curriculum.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that, in the end, this would achieve hardly anything in terms of 're-Christianising' America. Imposing laws on people will not change their hearts. Old Testament Israel bound all of its citizens to the laws of God, but a quick read through the prophets reveals that despite following these laws, their hearts remained bound to idols. The idea of re-Christianising America is in and of itself a misguided notion, but for the sake of argument, the point at which this begins is in the hearts of its people as they hear the gospel and respond to it in faith.&nbsp;Jesus did not entrust the Great Commission to public school teachers or to the government, but to his people. He gave us the task of making the known the good news of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Sociologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger">Peter Berger</a> has written of '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausibility_structure">plausibility structures</a>,' the idea being that people will embrace a system of actions and beliefs, an understanding of reality, that seems plausible to them. As Christians, our responsibility is to embody a biblical worldview such that it becomes a credible and alternative plausibility structure. If you want to talk about cultural change, it doesn't begin with legislating prayer in schools. It begins with Christians faithfully embodying the story of Scripture.</p>
<p>Parents, if you want your children to receive a Christian education, that is <em>your </em>responsibility. You cannot expect to send your children off to school and have them return as mature and faithful disciples of Christ, even under the best of circumstances. The Bible gives clear mandate for the primary role of parents in the education and formation of their children; Deuteronomy 6:6-9, which has been called <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-great-charter-of-christian-education">the great charter of Christian education</a>, serves as a clear example of this:</p>
<blockquote>
And these words that I command to you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, an they shall be as <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/frontlets.html">frontlets</a> between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
</blockquote>
<p>Although I have expressed my disagreement with the line of argument above and the understanding that presupposes it, I do readily agree that, by and large, the public school system is an environment that makes the task of raising children to love and serve the Lord a great challenge.&nbsp;For this reason, I am a proponent of Christian education by means of institutional Christian schools or homeschooling (although I certainly recognise both that Christians schools are not wholly immune to the problems of the public school system, and that not all parents are of the means to be able to take advantage of these alternatives).</p>
<p>Whatever form it takes, the important thing is that parents actively take a primary role in educating their children.&nbsp;Because children go through the educational system in their most formative years, it is so very crucial that parents are wholly conscious of the responsibility they have toward their children and are intentional and deliberate in their efforts to counter the worldview their children will come into contact with on a daily basis with the narrative of Scripture.&nbsp;And we as the church must ensure that we do not leave them alone in this task. We all have a responsibility for the children in our churches, and must give parents our wholehearted support in raising their children to love and fear the Lord, whether it be praying for them, teaching them in the context of the church's educational program, or mentoring and discipling them.</p>

In the end, it really makes no difference whether or not God is 'allowed' in the public schools. While it might be nice if the environment in which many children are educated were less hostile to our faith, the burden of responsibility to raise and educate children rests on the parents regardless of circumstances. What makes a difference is parents who seize hold of their calling to educate their children. If you want your children to receive an education that honours God and teaches them to be disciples of Christ, it begins with you.
