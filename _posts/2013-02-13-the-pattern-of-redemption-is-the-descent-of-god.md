<p>Many of the world's religions understand the goal and purpose of an  individual's life to be escape from this world, to be taken up into a higher reality, one beyond  what we can see and free from the curse of materiality. Despite explicit biblical teaching to the contrary, many Christians have long operated with eschatologies that bear  uncomfortable similarities to the salvific visions of these other  religions. They hold to a theology which anticipates complete   destruction of the physical world and expect God to take the souls of his   people away to live with him for eternity in some sort of disembodied,   spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Scripture, however, reveals a  pattern in God's redemptive  work in history that rejects this  all-to-common theological error – <strong>God comes to us.</strong></p>
<p>All throughout redemptive history, God comes to his people. It is    never the reverse. Right from the beginning, there is a sense in which the very act of creation is an act of God coming, as he creates something outside of himself, fills it with his goodness and glory, and goes to work actively sustaining it and actively working to carry out his plan for this creation. And the pattern continues – God creates man, and comes to him to make a covenant with him (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ge%202#q=&ref=Ge%202&ver=NIV">Gen. 2</a>). When Adam and Eve fall into sin, God comes to them with a promise of redemption (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ge%203.15#q=&ref=Ge%203%3A15&ver=NIV">Gen. 3:15</a>). God comes to Abraham to make a covenant with him and to call to himself a people, Israel (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ge%2012.1-3#q=&ref=Ge%2012%3A1-3%2Chi%3DGe%2012%3A1-Ge%2012%3A3&ver=NIV">Gen. 12:1-3</a>; <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ge%2017.1-8#q=&ref=Ge%2017%3A1-8%2Chi%3DGe%2017%3A1-Ge%2017%3A8&ver=NIV">17:1-8</a>). The nation of Israel is led into slavery in Egypt, but God comes to bring them out Egypt (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ex%2020.2#q=&ref=Ex%2020%3A2%2Chi%3DEx%2020%3A2&ver=NIV">Ex. 20:2</a>) and   leads them through the desert into the Promised Land. And when they take up their place in this new land, God comes to  dwell  with his people in the tabernacle and later the temple (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/1%20Ki%208.10-11#q=&ref=1%20Ki%208%3A10-11%2Chi%3D1%20Ki%208%3A10-1%20Ki%208%3A11&ver=NIV">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, all of Old Testament history points forward to the the most significant act of human history, when God comes to dwell among his people in the person of Jesus Christ (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Jn%201.14#q=&ref=Jn%201%3A14%2Chi%3DJn%201%3A14&ver=NIV">John 1:14</a>). In Jesus, God himself walks among us. After Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, he does not then leave us, but God comes again in the Holy Spirit to be continually present with his people (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ac%202.1-41#q=&ref=Ac%202%3A1-41%2Chi%3DAc%202%3A1-Ac%202%3A41&ver=NIV">Acts 2:1-41</a>). In addition, God continues to be present with his people in word and sacrament.</p>
<p>The pattern is the same, over and over: God comes, God comes, God comes. The eschatological implications of this reality should be obvious – in the   final act of redemptive history, Christ returning to consummate his   Kingdom, God again comes to us. He comes to us that we might dwell with   him forever. He comes to us to cleanse us from all sin and   unrighteousness, to make us holy. He comes to us, as Paul writes in   Philippians 3:21, to 'transform our lowly [bodies] to be like his   glorious body.' He comes to us to make us complete in him, to be   everything we are intended to be as images of God.</p>
<p>But there is more. Because Christ's return is the pinnacle of   redemptive history, his salvation will then be complete and extend as   far as the curse is found. His creation 'will be liberated from its   bondage to decay' (Romans 8:21) – renewed, restored, and glorified. God   again comes to earth to reclaim his good creation, to free it from the   strangling grip of sin and death, and to make all things new. This great eschatological reality is   beautifully portrayed in so many parts of Scripture, but particularly   notable are <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Php%203.21#q=&ref=Php%203%3A21%2Chi%3DPhp%203%3A21&ver=NIV">Amos 9:11-15</a>, <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Is%2062#q=&ref=Is%2062%2Chi%3DAm%209%3A11-Am%209%3A15&ver=NIV">Isaiah 62</a>; <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Is%2065.17-25#q=&ref=Is%2065%3A17-25%2Chi%3DIs%2065%3A17-Is%2065%3A25&ver=NIV">65:17-25</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Re%2021#q=&ref=Re%2021%2Chi%3DIs%2065%3A17-Is%2065%3A25&ver=NIV">Revelation 21-22</a>.</p>
<p>Some time ago, my friend <a href="http://apolojet.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Joe Torres</a> pointed me to the following paragraph from Esther Meek's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1608999289/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1608999289&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>Loving to Know: Covenant Epistemology</em></a>, which neatly summarises all of this:</p>
<blockquote>
God   descends to covenant creation into existence, and to sustain it,  every   atom in every moment. God descends to covenant with his people </span><span style="color: #5d5d5d;">–  to   dwell with them. God descends in the Incarnation. God descends in the    renewal of all things. The pattern of redemption, and the initiative of    the covenant relationship, is the descent of God.
</blockquote>

<strong>God comes to us</strong>. Understanding this pattern is key because it impacts all aspects of our theology and <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/god-initiates-we-respond-the-pattern-of-worship">our worship</a>,   and it <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html">shapes the way we live in this world</a>. But this is also cause for rejoicing in the sovereign, faithful, loving God who comes to us, calls us his own, and   dwells among us. Because unless he does so, we are without hope.
