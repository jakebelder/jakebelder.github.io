Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>26 May-01 June 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1173zFS">Religion is not Rules: The Unhelpfulness of Religion vs. Relationship</a></strong> – Here is another instalment of a discussion that keeps resurfacing every now and then, and one that <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/why-i-dont-like-the-gospel-vs.-religion-distinction">I've written on before</a> too. <a href="http://twitter.com/theochick">Lisa Robinson</a> makes some good points on this all-too-common distinction.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/150T8US">“Secure Your Own Mask First”</a></strong> – A good post by <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a>, who says that if Christians want to be a good witness to the world and to do good in the world, we need to first be concerned with taking care of ourselves.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/zaRK-0W5HQI">The Case for Man/Woman Marriage</a></strong> – Here is an interesting little video focusing the marriage debate on an important aspect of the discussion that is frequently being ignored and left out.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/173XLB8">Dear Parents with Young Children in Church</a></strong> – This open letter is written by a Lutheran pastor's wife with young kids offering some wonderful words of encouragement to other parents who keep their young children in church. She concludes, 'I know it’s hard, but thank you for what you do when you bring your children to church. Please know that your family - with all of its noise, struggle, commotion, and joy – are not simply tolerated, you are a vital part of the community gathered in worship.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1741SgE">You Can't Think Your Way to God</a></strong> – Here is a great interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> on the main points of his two most recent books, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035775/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035775&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Desiring the Kingdom</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801035783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801035783&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Imagining the Kingdom</a></em>. If you haven't read the books, do be sure to read the interview. But hopefully reading the interview will make you want to read the books.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1777d6J">Does Being Justified in Christ Result in Being Found a Sinner?</a></strong> – Though I studied Greek in university, I leave most of the heavy lifting when it comes to translating to the experts, and just learn from them. But I did find this post on the ESV's translation of Galatians 2:17 quite interesting.</li>
