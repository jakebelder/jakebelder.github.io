<p>Regeneration, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a>, is not a matter of something entirely new being created within us, but instead is a re-formation of human nature to what it was originally intended to be. There is no new substance added to what is already there, he writes in the first chapter of volume four of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Dogmatics-Baker-Publishing-Group/dp/0801035767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259845491&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Reformed Dogmatics</span></a>. He then extends the discussion to creation, and makes this profoundly important point:</p>
<blockquote>
Finally also the re-creation that will take place in the renewal of heaven and earth (Matt. 19:28) is not the destruction of this world and the subsequent creation out of nothing of another world but the liberation of the creature that is now subject to futility. Nor can it be otherwise, for God's honor as Savior hinges precisely on his reconquest from the power of Satan of <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> human race and <span style="font-style: italic;"> this</span> world. Christ, accordingly, is not a second Creator, but the Redeemer and Savior of this fallen creation, the Reformer of all things that have been ruined and corrupted by sin. Neither, for that matter, is sin a substance, but consists in lawlessness (Î¬&nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&alpha;); it is an actualized privation (<span style="font-style: italic;">privatio actuosa</span>) that has indeed violated the form (<span style="font-style: italic;">forma</span>) of the entire created world but did not and could not destroy its substance or essence. Hence, when the re-creation removes sin from creation, it does not deprive it of anything essential, nothing that was essentially and originally characteristic of it (though it was "by nature") and belonged to its essence. For sin is not part of the essence of creation; it pushed its way in later, as something unnatural and contrary to nature. Sin is deformity. When re-creation removes sin, it does not violate and suppress nature, but restores it.</blockquote>

This point cannot be made strongly enough, especially in evangelical circles <a href="http://www.jakebelder.com/2009/11/heaven-is-not-my-home.html">where creation is often not of great concern</a>. But the fact is, as Bavinck so clearly states, that if creation is not restored, sin gains victory and the Lordship of Christ is rendered null and void.
