<p>This is Alfonso. My wife and I met him in 2009 when we visited  Mexico. He was our tour guide at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_itza" target="_blank">Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute;</a>, a UNESCO world heritage site and pre-Columbian city  built by the Mayans, located in the Mexican state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n" target="_blank">Yucat&aacute;n</a> near the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid,_Yucat%C3%A1n" target="_blank">Valladolid</a>.</p>
<p>During the tour, we saw a Mayan calendar, and Alfonso discussed with us the fact that it ends on 21 December 2012. He  assured us that this was not because the Mayans expected the  world to end on this date, but only because it was the end of a time cycle. And given it was more than 5,300 years in the future from when they first made the calendar, they really saw no need to keep it going for any longer than that.</p>
<p>On what authority could he say such things? Alfonso is half-Mayan.</p>

And there you have it, straight from the horse's mouth. The world will not end tomorrow.
