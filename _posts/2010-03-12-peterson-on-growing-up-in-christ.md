<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Peterson">Eugene Peterson</a> will be here at <a href="http://www.rts.edu/site/about/campuses/orlando/index.aspx">RTS</a> next week for the annual <a href="http://www.rts.edu/newsevents/newsdetails.aspx?news_id=1355">Kistemaker Lectures</a>. I don't know too much about Peterson, aside from having read an article or two by him in the past, but I'm looking forward to hearing him. He has a reputation for possessing a great deal of wisdom in regards to pastoral concerns and various issues that arise in ministry.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I'm looking forward to the lectures is because of Peterson's commitment to Christian formation and discipleship (his title while at <a href="http://www2.regent-college.edu/bookstore/authors/epeterson/">Regent was Professor of Spiritual Theology</a>), and his recognition that the church is to be intimately involved in the lives of believers. The American church, both historically and presently, has demonstrated a great interest in saving souls and seeing people converted, but has not often invested in their lives as they subsequently learn what it looks like to have a life transformed by the gospel. Peterson addresses this in the introduction (and presumably the rest of the chapters) of his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Resurrection-Conversation-Growing-Christ/dp/0802829554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268408384&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Practice Resurrection: A Conversation on Growing up in Christ</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
We cannot overemphasize bringing men and women to new birth in Christ. Evangelism is essential, critically essential. But is it not obvious that growth in Christ is equally essential? Yet the American church has not treated it with an equivalent urgency. The American church runs on the euphoria and adrenaline of new birth&mdash;getting people into the church, into the kingdom, into causes, into crusades, into programs. We turn matters of growing up over to Sunday school teachers, specialists in Christian education, committees to revise curricula, retreat centers, and deeper life conferences, farming it out to parachurch groups for remedial assistance. I don't find pastors and professors, for the most part, very interested in matters of formation and holiness. The have higher profile things to tend to.<br><br>

Americans in general have little tolerance for a centering way of life that is submissive to the conditions in which growth takes place, quiet, obscure, patient, not subject to human control and management. The American church is uneasy in these conditions. Typically, in the name of 'relevance,' it adapts itself to the prevailing American culture and is soon indistinguishable from that culture; talkative, noisy, busy, controlling, image-conscious.<br><br>

Meanwhile, what has in previous centuries and other cultures been a major preoccupation of the Christian community, becoming men and women who live to 'the praise of God's glory,' has become a mere footnote within a church that has taken on the agenda of the secular society&mdash;its educational goals, its activity goals, its psychological goals. By delegating character formation, the life of prayer, the beauty of holiness&mdash;growing up in Christ&mdash;to specialized ministries or groups, we remove it from the center of the church's life. We disconnect growth from birth, and, in effect, place it on a bench at the margins of the church's life. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Berry">Wendell Berry</a>, one of our most perceptive prophets of contemporary culture and spirituality, wrote, 'We think it ordinary to spend twelve or sixteen or twenty years of a person's life and many thousands of public dollars on "education"&mdash;and not one dime or a thought on character.'
</blockquote>
<p>It takes a serious amount of effort to invest that much in someone's life, but Peterson obviously stands as an advocate for the essentiality of this fully-involved discipleship. And the Bible, of course, is replete with examples of this&mdash;one only need look to the three years Jesus spent in forming his disciples.</p>

If we truly believe that all of life is to be lived under the Lordship of Jesus Christ, we as the Church need to ensure that we become fully invested in each other's lives as we learn together what that looks like.
