<p>I was walking along <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westbourne+Avenue,+Hull&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.756552,-0.366025&amp;spn=0.0102,0.01929&amp;gl=uk&amp;hnear=Westbourne+Ave,+Hull,+North+Humberside+HU5,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0">Westbourne Avenue</a> in Hull today, and just happened to notice this small plaque on the side of one of the houses. While she only lived there a year, it was nonetheless very interesting to discover that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_L._Sayers">Dorothy Sayers</a> had lived here in Hull.</p>
<p>Seeing her name on the plaque brought to mind something I had read from her book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/091847731X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=091847731X">Creed or Chaos?: Why Christians Must Choose Either Dogma or Disaster</a></em>, a few years ago. There she writes,</p>
<blockquote>
The one thing I am here to say to you is this: that it is worse than useless for Christians to talk about the importance of Christian morality, unless they are prepared to take their stand upon the fundamentals of Christian theology. It is a lie to say that dogma does not matter; it matters enormously. It is fatal to let people suppose that Christianity is only a mode of feeling; it is virtually necessary to insist that it is first and foremost a rational explanation of the universe. It is hopeless to offer Christianity as a vaguely idealistic aspiration of a simple and consoling kind; it is, on the contrary, a hard, tough, exacting and complex doctrine, steeped in a drastic and uncompromising realism.
</blockquote>

Those are words to pay close attention to. Sayers is right on the mark &ndash; doctrine matters <em>enormously</em>.
