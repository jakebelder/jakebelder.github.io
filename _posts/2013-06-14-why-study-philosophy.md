‘Why study philosophy?’ asks [Luc Ferry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Ferry), in the introduction to his recent, best-selling book, *[A Brief History of Thought: A Philosophical Guide to Living](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0062074245/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0062074245&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. His answer:

<blockquote>
First of all, without it we can make no sense of the world in which we live. Philosophy is the best training for living, better even than history and the human sciences. Why? Quite simply because virtually all of our thoughts, convictions and values exist and have meaning – whether or not we are conscious of it – within models of the world that have been developed over the course of intellectual history. We must understand these models in order to grasp their reach, their logic and their consequences…<br><br>

Second, beyond coming to an understanding of oneself and others through acquaintance with the key texts of philosophy, we come to realise that these texts are able, quite simply, to help us live better and freer lives. As several contemporary thinkers note: one does not philosophise to amuse oneself, nor even to better understand the world and one’s own place in it, but sometimes literally to ‘save one’s skin’. There is in philosophy the wherewithal to conquer the fears which can paralyse us in life, and it is an error to believe that modern psychology, for example, can substitute for this…<br><br>

The philosophers of time past speak to us in the present tense. And this is worth contemplating… The great philosophical questions about how to live life remain relevant to this day (xiii-xv).
</blockquote>

I'm reminded of the similar perspective of two very different philosophers who lived in two very different periods in history. [Socrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) once said, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' And in a similar vein, [Francis Schaeffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Schaeffer) said, 'Philosophy is the only unavoidable occupation.' As Ferry rightly observes, it is important that we wrestle with these big questions of life, and weigh up the answers philosophers past and present have provided. This is especially true for Christians, because we believe that the ultimate answers to these questions are illuminated by the light of Scripture. For those who are seeking, then, we must provide environments in which these questions can be engaged with openly and honestly as we seek to communicate the truth God has revealed to us.
