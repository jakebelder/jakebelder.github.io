[Craig Ferguson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_ferguson), of late night TV fame, offers his opinion on why everything sucks:

Ferguson is usually very funny, but I've found that when he engages in cultural analysis like this, he is often quite perceptive as well. Here he picks up on something I have increasingly come to realize, that [adolescence is a social construct](http://evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/2010/09/teenagers-dont-exist.html). And marketers in this culture have not only recognized that, but seized onto it and been at the forefront of propagating the idea that we ought to prolong our youth. We no longer prize 'experience and wisdom', as Ferguson points out.

After you're done laughing, discuss: is the glorification of 'youth and stupidity' a real problem in our culture? How should the church address this issue?
