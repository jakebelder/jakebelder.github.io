<p>This is one of those quotes I wrote down a long time ago along with some scribbled, abbreviated footnote to indicate where it came from.  If you've seen my handwriting, you know this is problematic.  I know for sure that this comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geerhardus_Vos">Geerhardus Vos</a>, but from there the details get sketchy.  If I recall, I heard it in a lecture <a href="http://www.wts.edu/faculty/profile.html?id=15">William Edgar</a> gave, and it might be from an article Vos wrote on the book of Hebrews; but don't hold me to that.*  The quote, however, is still good:</p>
<blockquote>
To be a Christian is to live one's life not merely in obedience to God, not merely in dependence on God, not even merely for the sake of God.  It is to stand in conscious, reciprocal fellowship with God, to be identified with Him in thought and purpose and work, to receive from Him and give back to Him in the ceaseless interplay of spiritual forces.
</blockquote>

Indeed.
