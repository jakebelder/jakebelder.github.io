<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion">Marcion</a>, one of the infamous heretics of the ancient Church, saw the God of the Old Testament as one of strict justice, both ruthless and legalistic.  To him, this God stood antithetical to the God of the New Testament who was a figure of grace and redeeming love.  For this reason, when forming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon#Marcion_of_Sinope">his Scriptural canon</a>, Marcion rejected the Old Testament altogether and cut out large portions of the New Testament, those that reflected the Judaic God in any way.</p>
<p>Last night I was reading from the book of Exodus and was struck by how off the mark Marcion was.  I read from Exodus 15:1-16:36. Chapter 15 records what we often call the Song of Moses, his song of praise following Israel's release from Egypt and their deliverance from the hands of Pharaoh and his armies.  One of the things that stood out to me this time was that Exodus 15:1 says that it is not just Moses singing this song, but the Israelites altogether.  That made Exodus 15:24 stand out even more because after they sing this great song of praise&mdash;which is further recalled in such passages as in Psalm 78:52-53 and Psalm 105:37-45&mdash;here in verse 24 they are already grumbling and complaining only three days later.  God provides sweet water for them to drink in 15:25, and then after more grumbling and complaining from Israel, he provides manna and quail in 16:13-16.  Moses makes an important remark in 16:8: "Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord."</p>
<p>Contrary to Marcion's perception, this is a picture of God's covenant faithfulness, and the more you read of Israel's story the more you see that faithfulness.  Here in Exodus 15-16, just two chapters and the span of probably a couple months, Israel complains to God twice and disobeys his instructions twice, yet He remains faithful and is merciful and patient with them.</p>
<p>The story of Israel is often a disheartening one, especially when you realize how clearly it reflects us.  But the story of God's faithfulness is extraordinary.  Marcion was wrong. The God of the Old Testament is exactly the same as the God of the New Testament, one of grace, mercy, and love.  All of history is the story of God gathering His people to Himself, establishing them under His rule, and showering them with His blessing.  His covenant promises to His people remain forever.</p>

Israel was unfaithful.  We are unfaithful.  But God is <span style="font-style: italic;">eternally</span> faithful.
