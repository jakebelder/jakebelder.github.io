In his book, *[John Calvin: A Pilgrim's Life](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844743756/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1844743756&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, the Dutch church historian, [Herman Selderhuis](http://www.tua.nl/index.php?paginaID=33), gently reminds those who would consider themselves 'Calvinists' about Calvin's views on the frequency with which the Lord's Supper should be celebrated:

<blockquote>
Calvin wanted [the Lord's Supper] to be celebrated on a weekly basis. As the sign and seal of the Word, it was only to be expected that the Word would be followed by the sacrament. This has been a tradition established for centuries, so why should it be changed? The city council, however, considered this too radical a departure from what Bern and Zurich were accustomed to. They also thought it a little too 'Romish', and feared the people might get the same impression. Calvin cleverly suggested that the Lord's Supper be celebrated every four weeks, rotating among the four churches in Geneva. The council saw right through this proposal, however, and the syndics and councillors of Geneva decided that four celebrations per year would suffice. The millions of Reformed believers throughout the world who continue to uphold this practice are thus out of line with Calvin and are actually defending the position of the much less Reformed politicians of sixteenth-century Geneva (79-80).
</blockquote>

Selderhuis presses the point gently â€“ Calvin himself said that [infrequent celebration of the Lord's Supper was nothing less than the work of the devil](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/infrequent-celebration-of-the-lords-supper-is-the-devils-work)!
