<p>Last Monday evening, our home group leaders spent some time together  talking about how to deal with criticism as a leader in the church. It  is something we inevitably face, but something that can be instrumental  in helping us grow in wisdom and holiness. Part of our discussion  focused on something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon">Charles Spurgeon</a> once said:</p>
<blockquote>
Brother,  if any man thinks ill of you, do not be angry with him; for you are  worse than he thinks you to be. If he charges you falsely on some point,  yet be satisfied, for if he knew you better he might change the  accusation, and you would be no gainer by the correction. If you have  your moral portrait painted, and it is ugly, be satisfied; for it only  needs a few blacker touches, and it would be still nearer the truth.
</blockquote>

Puts things in perspective, that.
