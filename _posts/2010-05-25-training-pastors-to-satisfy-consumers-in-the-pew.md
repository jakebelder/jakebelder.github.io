<p>&nbsp;I remember reading the following, from Eugene Peterson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Angles-Shape-Pastoral-Integrity/dp/0802802656/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274811500&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Working the Angles: The Shape of Pastoral Integrity</em></a>, somewhere before, a few years ago. When I saw that <a href="http://barach.us">John Barach</a> had posted it, I copied and pasted it here because it is characteristic of Peterson's incisiveness and wisdom, and his ability to systematically expose the rampant consumerism at work in American evangelicalism. Here he laments the way the pastorate has become just another tool used to satisfy the wants of the consumers in the pew.</p>
<blockquote>
For a long time I have been convinced that I could take a person with  a high school education, give him or her a six-month trade school  training, and provide a pastor who would be satisfactory to any  discriminating American congregation.  The curriculum would consist of  four courses.  <em>Course I</em>: Creative Plagiarism.  I would put you  in touch with a wide range of excellent and inspirational talks, show  you how to alter them just enough to obscure their origins, and get you a  reputation for wit and wisdom.  <em>Course II</em>: Voice Control for  Prayer and Counseling.  We would develop your own distinct style of Holy  Joe intonation, acquiring the skill in resonance and modulation that  conveys an unmistakable aura of sanctity.  <em>Course III</em>:  Efficient Office Management.  There is nothing that parishioners admire  more in their pastors than the capacity to run a tight ship  administratively.  If we return all telephone calls within twenty-four  hours, answer all letters within a week, distributing enough carbons to  key people so that they know we are on top of things, and have just the  right amount of clutter on our desks &mdash; not too much or we appear  inefficient, not too little or we appear underemployed &mdash; we quickly get  the reputation for efficiency that is far more important than anything  that we actually do.  <em>Course IV</em>: Image Projection.  Here we  would master the half-dozen well-known and easily implemented devices  that create the impression that we are terrifically busy and widely  sought after for counsel by influential people in the community.  A  one-week refresher course each year would introduce new phrases that  would convince our parishioners that we are bold innovators on the  cutting edge of the megatrends and at the same time solidly rooted in  all the traditional values of our sainted ancestors.<br><br>

(I have been laughing for several years over this trade school  training for pastors with which I plan to make my fortune.  Recently,  though, the joke has backfired on me.  I keep seeing advertisements for  institutes and workshops all over the country that invite pastors to  sign up for this exact curriculum.  The advertised course offerings are  not quite as honestly labeled as mine, but the content appears to be  identical &mdash; a curriculum that trains pastors to satisfy the current  consumer tastes in religion.  I&rsquo;m not laughing anymore.) [7-8]

Pastoral ministry is not about giving people what they want. Instead, it is about giving people <a href="http://jakebelder.com/ever-only-all-for-thee">what they <em>need</em></a>. While at first we may, with Peterson, laugh a little about this, we too must come to the point where we are not laughing about this anymore. When it is all said and done, this is not just a matter of wants versus needs, or likes versus dislikes. The reality is that this a matter of life and death.
