Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 267px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Baghdad_street.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>23 February-01 March 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1c3PcKH">When is a priest not a priest?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">Anthony Smith</a> does a bit of a linguistic study on the language of priesthood, and makes some interesting observations with a view in particular to how it's used in the Church of England.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/NtKs5u">Priestly Service in Romans 6</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alastair Roberts</a> looks at Romans 6:1-23 and makes some observations on how the way this passage is usually interpreted might not go deep enough. He suggests that being made "slaves to righteousness" ought to be construed as a sort of priestly consecration to service.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ejYBg5">My Evangelical Story Isn’t So Bad</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> looks at how our stories and experiences shape us and our theology with some personal reflections on his own evangelical upbringing. <a href="http://bit.ly/1hyjS4q">Alastair Roberts then responds to Derek's post</a> with some interesting thoughts on the whole idea of story and narrative and how our stories can actually deceive us and cause us to look at ourselves and others through unhelpfully-coloured lenses. Ultimately, Alastair concludes, "we are being given another, better Story. It is no longer the self-narrated ‘I’ who lives, but the ‘I’ who is, by the breath of the Spirit, being re-narrated in the form of the story of Christ." This is a really interesting conversation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1c89UZT">The Vicar of Baghdad</a></strong> – This is a fascinating piece on <a href="http://twitter.com/vicarofbaghdad">Andrew White</a>, the Anglican chaplain to Baghdad, with some stories and insights into what it's like to minister in one of the most dangerous cities in the world.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1kn00mF">Authenticating Ourselves to Death</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/TheAlanNoble">Alan Noble</a> has a great post here on our obsession with identity and authenticity, and how any endeavour to find our true identity apart from Christ will not end well.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1mFQ0pT">Making God’s Mercy Tangible</a></strong> – Here is an interview (and <a href="http://www.washingtoninst.org/7564/making-gods-mercy-tangible-an-interview-with-chris-sicks-part-2-of-2/">part 2 is here</a>) with <a href="http://twitter.com/ChrisSicks">Chris Sicks</a>, the author of a new book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1612914411/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1612914411&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Tangible: Making God Known Through Deeds of Mercy and Words of Truth</a></em>. He has some reflections on how apologetics is all about targeting the head, when the reality is that most people who object to Christianity don't do so because they are blind to God, but because they don't trust God. The book itself focuses on what he calls an apologetics of mercy, which is all about giving people the opportunity to tangibly taste and see that the Lord is good. I find this all very interesting because this is reflective of my experience with apologetics.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1d0nU5K">Seal of Baptism</a></strong> – Some observations from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> on how modern baptismal theology has departed from the theology of the Reformation, especially with its hesitancy to talk about the efficacy and necessity of baptism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1d0pX9X">Faithful Compromise</a></strong> – A great piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> on how "compromise has increasingly been a lost art in our public life as we have come to prize ideological purity over brokered effectiveness." As we seek shalom, we have to realise that we will not bring about the Kingdom in this life and that there are limits to what we can do. Understanding this helps us to think carefully about where to invest our time and efforts.</li>
