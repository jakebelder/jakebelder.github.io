<p>Being the product of Western society that I am, it is sometimes difficult for me to adopt a posture of humility and to accept the authority and wisdom of others. In the past while I have written a lot about the Church, and when I enter into the realm of something I am so passionate about, I especially need to be on my guard about how I approach this issue. I read and I think a lot about the Church because I want to know more about it. Given that it is such a fundamental part of my life, I think that is also my responsibility. For that reason, I have made it a commitment to ensure that my understanding of the Church is thoroughly biblical.</p>
<p>But this sometimes makes me critical of things that I see in the Church. Now, I know that there is a place for that as we work together as members of that body to keep focused on her mission and calling in this world. However, I sometimes catch myself being too critical and crediting myself with more wisdom and theological clarity than I actually have, to the degree that I discredit the wisdom and insight of others, both laymen and those in authority in the Church whose experiences far outweigh my own. I realize they are just as subject to error as I am, but I need to be a little more <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov%2010:19;%2017:27%20&amp;version=47">quick to listen</a>, and not so eager to adopt the character of a lone ranger.</p>
<p>Earlier I stated that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/confessionalism-a-communal-hermeneutic">truth is determined and upheld in community</a>. That community is not only the people we surround ourselves with, but extends throughout the Church universal, both past and present. We are <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2012:12-31;&amp;version=47;">one body made up of many parts</a>, and together we work towards being a faithful witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Only once in history did one man lay sole and rightful claim to the truth, and when he ascended to heaven he left that truth with the Church and gave her the Holy Spirit to help preserve it.</p>

It is not to be denied that God may grant an individual great insight into matters of the Church, faith, and theology. But the community of the faithful is the greater guarantor that what is determined in these matters is faithful to the Scriptures and to the mission and witness of the Church (eg. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2015;&amp;version=47;">Acts 15</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_seven_Ecumenical_Councils">first seven ecumenical councils</a>, etc.). Seldom is there a place for a lone ranger in the body of Christ.
