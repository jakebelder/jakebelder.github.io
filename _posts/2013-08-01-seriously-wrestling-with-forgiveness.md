My bedtime reading recently has been [Charlotte Mary Yonge’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Mary_Yonge) classic novel, *[The Heir of Redclyffe](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0082XM84S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0082XM84S&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, which I've found to be one of the most enjoyable works of literature I have read (although I must ashamedly admit I haven't read all that many). The reason I initially decided to read it was because I once heard it was [Abraham Kuyper’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper) favourite novel, and played an instrumental role in [reawakening his faith](http://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/factsheet_abraham.pdf).

One of the things that makes this novel so captivating is the way in which Yonge both understands the heart and the true nature of forgiveness and repentance. This comes out particularly in one of the main characters, Guy Morville, who is the victim of a serious character assassination, perpetrated by his cousin, Philip. Guy is a man of deep faith, however, and so Instead of retaliating, he goes to great lengths to forgive Philip. This is no easy thing for Guy to do, and Yonge paints a vivid picture of the internal struggle he goes through to get to the point of forgiveness. At one point, Guy is sitting alone thinking about what has happened and, sensing the presence of a sort of demon that is urging him to seek revenge, Guy enters in a battle to fight that demon:

<blockquote>
It was horror at such wickedness that first checked him, and brought him back to the combat. His was not a temper that was satisfied with half measures. He locked his hands more rigidly together, vowing to compel himself, ere he left the spot, to forgive his enemy – forgive him candidly – forgive him, so as to never again have to say, ‘I forgive him!’ He did not try to think, for reflection only lashed up his sense of the wrong: but, as if there was power in the words alone, he forced his lips to repeat, –<br><br>

‘Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.’<br><br>

Coldly and hardly were they spoken at first; again he pronounced them, again, again, – each time the tone was softer, each time they came more from the heart. At last the remembrance of greater wrongs, and worse revilings came upon him, his eyes filled with tears, the most subduing and healing of all thoughts – that of the great Example – became present to him; the foe was driven back.<br><br>

Still he kept his hands over his face. The tempter was not yet defeated without hope. It was not enough to give up his first intention (no great sacrifice, as he perceived, now that he had time to think how Philip would be certain to treat a challenge), it was not enough to wish no ill to his cousin, to intend no evil measure, he must pardon from the bottom of his heart, regard him candidly, and not magnify his injuries.
</blockquote>

Yonge's powerful portrayal of Guy's earnest desire to repent and forgive Philip caused me to stop reading at this point and search my own heart. I have not been wronged by someone to the extent that Philip wronged Guy, but it did make me consider whether I have been as thorough in my own repentance and forgiveness. I also wonder if too often we think of forgiveness as simply trying to forget the wrong someone has done to us, when really it is something much deeper than that.

Later in the book, Yonge again returns to Guy's self-reflection, as he walks to church for a Communion service. Seeking to ensure that he has truly repented and truly forgiven Philip, Guy examines himself thoroughly, and it is clear he has the following words from the [Book of Common Prayer](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-lord%27s-supper-or-holy-communion.aspx) on his mind as he does so:

<blockquote>
Ye that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and are in love and charity with your neighbours, and intend to lead a new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy ways: Draw near with faith, and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort...
</blockquote>

And so Yonge writes,

<blockquote>
Many a question he did ask himself, to certify whether he wilfully entertained malice or hatred, or any uncharitableness. It was a long, difficult examination; but at its close, he felt convinced that, if such passions knocked at the door of his heart, it was not at his own summons, and that he drove them away without listening to them. And surely he might approach to gain the best aid in that battle, especially as he was certain of his strong and deep repentance for his fit of passion, and longing earnestly for the pledge of forgiveness.
</blockquote>

Not only does Yonge understand the heart, then, but she also understands the place of worship in shaping and forming the heart. Guy longs to partake of Communion because he longs to be reminded again the promises of the Gospel and of the forgiveness he has received in Christ.  And he knows this practice is not just a ritual, but is something formative, something in which he receives grace and is enabled more and more to live faithfully. Indeed, in the end, Guy's repentance and forgiveness ends up having an incredibly powerful effect on some of the other characters in the novel, including Philip.

This is all very interesting when you consider that Kuyper read *The Heir of Redclyffe* as a theologically liberal student, because this concern for personal faith and repentance is something largely absent in liberal Christianity. And although I am not aware of what it was in particular in the novel that impressed itself upon him, I suspect that the deep reality of personal faith and the understanding of spiritual life that Yonge portrays in Guy had something to do with it. Whatever it was, it reignited an orthodox, living faith in a man who went on to have a major impact on the world around him, and whose impact continues to be felt by many today.
