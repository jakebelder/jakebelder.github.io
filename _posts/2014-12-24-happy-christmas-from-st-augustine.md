Some wonderful words from [Augustine's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) homily, '[Truth has arisen from the earth and justice has looked down from heaven](http://www.liturgies.net/Liturgies/Catholic/loh/advent/december24or.htm)â€™, as we prepare to celebrate Christmas tomorrow:

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 1px 0px 20px; width: 425px; height: 300px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/Adoration%20of%20the%20Shepherds.jpg" alt="Adoration of the Shepherds, Charles le Brun" width="420"></div>

<blockquote>
Awake, mankind! For your sake God has become man. Awake, you who sleep, rise up from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you. I tell you again: for your sake, God became man.<br><br>

You would have suffered eternal death, had he not been born in time. Never would you have been freed from sinful flesh, had he not taken on himself the likeness of sinful flesh. You would have suffered everlasting unhappiness, had it not been for this mercy. You would never have returned to life, had he not shared your death. You would have been lost if he had not hastened to your aid. You would have perished, had he not come.<br><br>

Let us then joyfully celebrate the coming of our salvation and redemption. Let us celebrate the festive day on which he who is the great and eternal day came from the great and endless day of eternity into our own short day of time.
</blockquote>

A very happy Christmas to you all.
