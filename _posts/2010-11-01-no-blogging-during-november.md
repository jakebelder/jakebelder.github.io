With apologies to those of you who so eagerly look forward to the posts on this blog, I have decided to take a month off from blogging.

The main reason for the hiatus is simply that I have too much going on right now to devote time to this space. I'm working a lot and I have a number of commitments in the evenings throughout the week that leave me with very little free time. I want to spend more time with my wife, leave more time for the practical responsibilities of life, and do some reading again.

So, for the next month, I am putting the pen down. I will continue to interact with comments if they are posted, and plan to remain active on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jakebelder).

Posting on the blog will resume again in December.
