John Stott, in his book, *[The Cross of Christ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844741559/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1844741559)*, briefly mentions the role of the image of a fish in early Christianity:

<blockquote>
Only the initiated would know, and nobody else could guess, that <em>icthys</em> ('fish') was an acronym for <em>Iesus Christos Theou Huios SotÄ“r</em> ('Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'). But it did not remain the Christian sign, doubtless because the association between Jesus and a fish was purely acronymic (a fortuitous arrangement of letters) and had no visual significance.
</blockquote>

Clearly Stott never had the privilege of [driving around 21st century America](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RoFf0W8nCJo/SoctWwVM8HI/AAAAAAAABlU/7PpeW70mQsk/s400/ichthus-school-fish-7.jpg).
