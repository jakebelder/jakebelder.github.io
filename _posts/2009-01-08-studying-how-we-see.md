<p>For quite a while now I have been following the <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes">BookNotes</a> blog, authored by Byron Borger, who runs a bookstore up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallastown,_Pennsylvania">Dallastown, Pennsylvania</a>, called <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/">Hearts &amp; Minds</a>.  The bookstore stocks books on all kinds of topics with the intent of helping people learn how to live out the truth of the Lordship of Jesus Christ in all areas of their life. <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes/living_at_the_crossroads_in_th/"> Borger's latest post</a> focuses on what lies at the root of learning how to live in that way.  He says,</p>

<blockquote>
The fruitful way to integrate and live out a robust, multi-faceted, culture-making, spiritually-alive and Biblically faithful way of life in the world is to be intentional about studying how we see. Yes, our view of things, our imaginative constructs, our assumptions and attitudes, our underlying values, all shape how we think about all of life. The glasses we wear colors our interpretation of everything, and our subsequent views of discipleship&mdash;what to do and what not to do, and how to do the most ordinary things, how to make sense out of life, and how to live&mdash;are informed by our vision, the glasses we wear.  The most effective, lasting and radical way to get church folks equipped for a life of service before God in the real world is to focus a bit from time to time on seeing life Christianly, from God's viewpoint.  That is, we must study the topic of worldview.
</blockquote>

<p>What Borger says here is crucial, and I could not agree more. <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes/living_at_the_crossroads_in_th/">Click here to go read the rest of the post</a>, because he follows this discussion with a recommendation of a number of books on the topic, some of which I have read and have impacted me tremendously, others of which I know are excellent and look forward to reading as soon as I can</p>

I encourage you to read <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes">BookNotes</a> on a regular basis if you, like myself, are always in the market for good books.  Borger's recommendations are always thoughtful, carefully selected, and thoroughly reviewed.  In addition, all his recommendations usually come with a special discount offer you can access through the website.
