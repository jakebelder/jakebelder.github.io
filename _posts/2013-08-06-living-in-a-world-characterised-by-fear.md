The French philosopher, [Luc Ferry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Ferry), in his book, *[A Brief History of Thought: A Philosophical Guide to Living](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0062074245/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0062074245&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, notes that in this modern age where we possess technology of almost unthinkable power, we increasingly live in fear of the future:

<blockquote>
For the first time in the history of life, a living species holds the means to destroy the entire planet, and this species does not know where it is going. Its powers of transformation and, if need be, of destruction, are by now unbounded, but like a giant with the faculties of an infant, they are totally dissociated from any capacity for reflection…<br><br>

No one today can seriously claim to believe in a guarantee of survival for our species, and many are troubled, but no one knows how to take the reins: from Kyoto protocols to ecological summits, our heads of state participate impotently, brandishing a rhetoric crammed with pious hopes but with no real power to control even those scenarios most clearly identified as potentially catastrophic. The worst does not always come to pass, and nothing prevents us of course from remaining optimistic, but this is more an act of faith than having any basis in reason. Hence the Enlightenment ideal gives way to a diffuse and multiform anxiety, always at the ready to focus upon this or that particular threat, in such a way that fear is slowly becoming the characteristic democratic emotion (216).
</blockquote>

As Christians, of course, our perspective is entirely the opposite – we live in complete confidence with respect to the future. Though we don't know everything that will happen, we know that Christ will return to bless his people, and that we will share in his final victory over sin and death as he fully redeems and restores his creation. I wish I had read this passage from Ferry's book before I [preached on Revelation 4 a few months ago](http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/m3u.asp?id=1982), because it would have been helpful to quote it in that sermon. Words like this greatly illuminate the hope we have because our God has total and complete control over the whole of creation.
