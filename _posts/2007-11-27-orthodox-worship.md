Fr. Stephen Freeman is an Orthodox priest in Tennessee. He was formerly an Episcopalian priest before he converted to Orthodoxy. I’ve been reading his blog, [Glory to God for All Things](http://glory2godforallthings.com/), for some time, and have really enjoyed it. He provides some wonderful insights into Orthodoxy, and sometimes also deals with Orthodoxy in the American context.

In his latest two posts, Fr. Stephen has dealt with this relation of America and the Orthodox church. In one post, he spoke of the growing trend in American evangelical churches towards marketing (though I may disagree that it is a "growing" trend---it may have reached a plateau with the advent of postmodern Christianity and the Emerging Church movement). Specifically speaking of worship music, Fr. Stephen says that the American church tends to enculturate its music style in order to grow the church. In contrast, of Orthodoxy he says this:

<blockquote>
There is no way to say to someone, 'Our music is superior to yours.' That's a very arguable statement. I do prefer the theological substance and meat of an Orthodox hymn when compared to the average American 'praise song,' but I will not claim musical superiority. What I can observe is that Orthodox music (indeed Orthodox everything) is not market driven. *It is what it is and you learn it as it is.* The same is true for the faith. We teach what was given us and what has been 'organically' part of the Orthodox Tradition. The faith remains the same whether the 'market' is a village in Africa or a suburb of Los Angeles. It is thus truly 'inclusive' and 'universal' in the extreme.
</blockquote>

I gather that Fr. Stephen is making the argument that a church should stick what it has developed organically. Appealing to the longevity of the Orthodox Church and it's preservation of worship and tradition, Fr. Stephen says,

<blockquote>
Tragically, I’ve heard of some market-driven Churches seeking to put together services that would feel more 'ancient,' with a bit of ritual, incense and chant. It is tragic because these things are not organically part of who they are but simply another stab at the American market. As such it cannot save because it itself is captive to mammon and the culture of the market.<br><br>

Whether these current phenomena will continue in Evangelicalism is anybody's guess. I have no idea. What Orthodoxy will continue to do I can describe with a fair assurance of being right. We'll be doing what we've always done, with occasional new hymns written (we do still write music) - but it will be much like what has gone before. For some that is a comfort.
</blockquote>

I'll have more response to this to follow.
