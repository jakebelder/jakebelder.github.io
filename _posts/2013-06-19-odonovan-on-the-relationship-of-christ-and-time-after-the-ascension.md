One of the big questions which is frequently on my mind has to do with the relationship of redemption and time. I owe the initial prompting of these ongoing thoughts to [Nelson Kloosterman](http://www.worldviewresourcesinternational.com/nelson-kloosterman/), who jotted down some [musings on the subject in a post last year](http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/a-d-2012-reflections-on-the-calendar/). Since then, I continue to take a lot of interest in anything that addresses time through a theological lens.

Most recently, I encountered this in [Oliver O’Donovan’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_O%27Donovan) book, *[On the Thirty-Nine Articles: Conversations with Tudor Christianity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HITR40/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B005HITR40&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, which I just finished reading. He raises the question of the relationship of Christ and time in the context of a discussion on [Article IV](http://www.thirtyninearticles.org/religion/#IV._Of_the_Resurrection_of_Christ.) and the ascension. O’Donovan suggests that Jesus’ ascension means not only his elevation “beyond the limits of ‘our’ space, it means also the elevation beyond the limits of ‘our’ time” (32). He notes that we often think of Jesus continuing to exist and act *within* time as we know it, both as he acts to intercede for us and as we he waits for the time of his return.

O’Donovan observes, however, that particularly when the writer to the Hebrews talks about the intercessory work of Christ after his ascension (Hebrews 7:23-25), he understands it to be “a decisive once-for-all act of intercession, not a long-drawn-out one” (32). Further, when the writer to the Hebrews speaks of Christ sitting down at the right hand of God waiting for his enemies to be made his footstool (Hebrews 10:12-13), the emphasis is not on the duration of time, but instead on the expectancy that this will happen. O Donovan’s comments on this are quite interesting:

<blockquote>
What we see in the Epistle to the Hebrews is something very characteristic of the New Testament as a whole, the assertion that the Christ-event is the <em>last thing</em> in God’s plan for the world, and that with its completion the end of time has, in effect, already come. We are seen to have our existence, as it were, in the middle of the end, in between the last things and the last things. Still to come is the universal manifestation of Christ’s glory, but the time-lapse which separates that from the accomplishment of that glory in the ascension is of no significance. It serves the function of permitting the gospel to be preached to the end of the earth, but it does not add to, or subtract from, God’s saving deed. Thus we find, both in the Scriptures and in the creeds, that the ascension and the <em>parousia</em> (the return) of Christ are seen together, almost as one event. When Christ sits down at the right hand of God, that is not a gesture of patient waiting, but of triumph. The triumph is already achieved; it only remains for that triumph to be manifested universally. Christ ascended has reached the fulfilment of man’s destiny; he is already at the end of time. Mankind will follow him to that fulfilment. Time is thus not an iron cage, within which all events are bound, but a dimension of history – and in the fulfilment of the purpose of history in Christ we see that time, too, is fulfilled (33).
</blockquote>

I really have no comment to make; I only wanted to note O’Donovan’s observations. Given some of Kloosterman’s points [in his post](http://cosmiceye.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/a-d-2012-reflections-on-the-calendar/) from last year, though, I would be quite interested to know what he thinks of O’Donovan’s view of the relationship of Christ and time, and what he would say about this.

But, of course, I welcome any thoughts on this complex matter, which you can contribute below.
