Recently I have been working my way through [Anthony Trollope’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Trollope) series of novels collectively known as [The Chronicles of Barsetshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Barsetshire). One of the things I enjoy about Trollope’s writing (although it took me a bit of time to get used to) is the way in which he intersperses comments from his own perspective into the narrative. In the middle of telling the story, he will pause and take a minute to reflect on something the story has drawn out, often something to do with human nature, and it is almost as if you are sitting there actually having a conversation with him.

Sometimes those reflections are more poignant than others, such as this from *[Barchester Towers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0192834320)*:

<blockquote>
Considering how much we are all given to discuss the characters of others, and discuss them often not in the strictest spirit of charity, it is singular how little we are inclined to think that others can speak ill-naturedly of us, and how angry and hurt we are when proof reaches us that they have done so. It is hardly too much to say that we all of us occasionally speak of our dearest friends in a manner in which those dearest friends would very little like to hear themselves mentioned; and that we nevertheless expect that our dearest friends shall invariably speak of us as though they were blind to all our faults, but keenly alive to every shade of our virtues (194-195).
</blockquote>

Trollope is right, of course. A good mix of James 4:11 and Matthew 7:12 would do us all well.
