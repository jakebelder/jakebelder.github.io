Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 256px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/stress.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>11-17 August 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/11YGJku">How to Survive Reaching the Edge of Heartbreak at Work</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a> writes about the need to cultivate a robust spirituality to help us deal with difficulties that arise in our work and vocation, and he urges us particularly to root this spirituality in the Psalms.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15uoyQG">Do This</a></strong> – Here is an excellent piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart">Peter Leithart</a> on what goes wrong when evangelicals neglect the Lord's Supper. He notes that the church is called to keep the death and resurrection of Christ central to her mission, and that this is nurtured not just by the Word, but also by coming together at the Table. He concludes, "All the cultural and political challenges that Evangelicals face come back to the Supper."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15y3FnH">Robertson on Continuity between Creation and Redemption</a></strong> – If you haven't read O. Palmer Robertson's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0875524184/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0875524184">The Christ of the Covenants</a></em>, you should. It contains many gems like the paragraph quoted here. I've also written before <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/how-the-covenant-of-creation-shapes-our-calling">on how Robertson links creation and redemption</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15y4vAM">Incarnation in the City</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/BethanyJenkins">Bethany Jenkins</a> writes about the wonder of the incarnation and how it should impact our life in this world, suggesting five ways it particularly shapes the way we live. She concludes, "When we live in light of the incarnation of Christ, our lives will be shocking to others... Yet we will point to the miracle of the incarnation of Christ. Our lives will testify to the great news of Advent. That news is this: Christ has come, God is with us."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dcFx1p">How To Deliver a Talk Without Using Notes</a></strong> – When I first saw someone link to this article I wanted to read it because I've always wanted to be less bound to my notes when I'm preaching. I think there are some things to learn here, but the article's main focus seems to be on being an 'effective communicator', suggesting that preaching is less effective when you don't use notes. Much more could be said on this, but ultimately what makes preaching effective is the Spirit working in and through the preacher and the Word, and in the hearts of the listeners. In the end, notes are inconsequential.</li>
