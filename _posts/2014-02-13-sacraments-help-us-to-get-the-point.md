[Andrew Davison](http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-andrew-davison), at the beginning of his recent book, *[Why Sacraments?](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0281063923/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0281063923&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, discusses how the sacraments help us to understand grace and forgiveness:

<blockquote>
In one of his miracles, Christ explores the dynamic of making profound but hidden things visible. Presented with a paralytic, Christ forgives his sins (Matt. 9:2-5). This provokes an accusation of blasphemy from the teachers of the law. Christ replies with a question: ‘Which is easier to say…”Your sins are forgiven”, or to say, “Stand up and take your mat and walk”?’ Christ has already said one of these things; he goes on to say the other: ‘stand up, take your mat and go to your home’, which the paralytic does. Jesus explains the logic of what he is up to in his actions: the healing reveals that he does have ‘authority on earth to forgive sins’ (Mark 2:9-11).<br><br>

The forgiveness of sins is an inward and invisible grace. It is profoundly important, and we may well be able to see some of its effects. As an event, however, forgiveness goes unseen. In his exchange with the teachers of the law, Christ underlines the fact that human beings need ‘outward and visible signs’ to accompany ‘inward and invisible grace’: if we are to be captivated, if we are to have our doubts and fears allayed, if we are really going to get the point. A sacrament is classically defined as just such an ‘outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible grace’ (2).

I like that – sacraments help us to get the point.
