My name is [Jake Belder](http://twitter.com/jakebelder), and I live in [Durham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_England) in the northeast of England, where I’m training for ordained ministry in the [Church of England](http://churchofengland.org/) at [Cranmer Hall](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/) and working towards a [Doctor of Theology and Ministry](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/study-with-us/postgraduate-courses#doc). I consider [Hamilton, Ontario, Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario) my hometown.

Like most aspiring theologians, I basically spend my days reading and drinking coffee, although people are often surprised to discover that I am also an avid automotive enthusiast. I’m married to Robin, and we have two children.

I've called this blog <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com"><strong>Notes in the Margins</strong></a> because most of what I write is a reflection on things I have been reading, expanding on the notes I make in the margins of books as I 'converse' with the authors, usually on topics centred around ministry and theology. I don't wait to write until I've got a perfectly polished piece, and so what you read here should not be taken as my definitive thinking on a particular subject. This is very much 'thinking in progress', and as such, I welcome your contributions to the conversations.

For fun, [I review cars when I hire them](http://cars.jakebelder.com).
