<p>My wife and I just returned from a lovely weekend in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges" target="_blank">Bruges</a>, a city in north-west Belgium full of old, beautiful buildings, <a href="http://www.halvemaan.be/index.php?id=15&amp;L=2" target="_blank">great beer</a>, and those delectable Belgian waffles. It was also a weekend away from social media, which was quite refreshing especially as the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/general-synod/agendas-and-papers/november-2012-group-of-sessions.aspx" target="_blank">General Synod</a> of the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org" target="_blank">Church of England</a> approaches, and many people have taken to vocalising their thoughts and opinions regarding the significant discussion that will be had on the matter of women being ordained as bishops.</p>

<p>The church I belong to and work for is part of the conservative evangelical camp of the Church of England, a smaller grouping of churches who by and large still maintain traditional understandings of office and ordination, which specifically entails the understanding that the offices of the church are closed to women. In 1993, when women were permitted to be ordained as priests, traditionalists (both of the evangelical and Anglo-Catholic persuasion) were assuaged to some degree with a provision that would ensure a woman was not appointed as a vicar or priest in their parishes. As the matter of the ordination of women to the episcopate approaches, along with <a href="http://yes2womenbishops.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">a campaign to get Synod to vote in favour of the measure</a>, traditionalists are again worried about what this will look like, and <a href="http://together4ward.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">whether or not proper provision will continue to be made for them</a>.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the position of conservative evangelicals in the Church of England. Last week, I got into a bit of a Twitter conversation about some of these things, and as I spent time mulling it all over, I thought a few observations might be in order. Bear in mind that these are just some things I quickly jotted down, and I welcome your thoughts below.</p>
<p>My first observation has nothing to do with the theological issues surrounding this discussion. The simple fact of the matter is that the only logical move at this point would be to permit women to be ordained to the office of bishop. Since they can already be ordained to the priesthood they should be ordained to the episcopate as well. The current arrangement has led many supporters of the measure to say that the country looks at the Church of England as a joke so long as women are not permitted to serve in every position of leadership in the institution. Whilst this argument in itself is rubbish in terms of giving rationale for the decision &ndash; after all, the Bible must be given precedence in shaping our ecclesial practices and not the ideologies of our culture &ndash; it is, very simply, strange to allow women to be ordained to only one office. Let me hasten to add that this is not the primary argument for many of those in favour of the measure, and they do, in fact, have theological arguments for their position. But all I am saying here is that passing the measure at Synod would just be a logical move.</p>
<p>Secondly, I must admit that I do not understand those within the conservative evangelical camp who fight doggedly for male oversight. Their theological rationale is clear, I can understand that, but given the nature of the institution, I have to wonder why this is the qualification that outweighs all others. What I sometimes hear them saying is that they would rather have episcopal oversight from a man who is theologically liberal and stands against so many things they stand for both doctrinally and in terms of mission, than from a woman who believes the gospel and who desires to see people converted and joined to the community of believers. This simply makes no sense to me. What validates a person's ministry? Their gender, or their commitment to the gospel? If both, then perhaps the only answer is to look elsewhere for oversight (<a href="http://www.co-mission.org.uk/Groups/175156/Co_Mission/ABOUT_US/A_M_I/A_M_I.aspx" target="_blank">as some have already done</a>). But if it comes down to choosing between the two, surely the latter is more important when it comes to the advancement of the gospel and the growth of the church in England.</p>
<p>Third, and as many people continue to point out, all this reveals the irreparably fractured nature of the Church of England. Conservative evangelicals continue to maintain that the Church of England is 'theirs'; that is, they are the most faithful to historic Anglicanism and biblical orthodoxy. Mainline and liberal Anglicans continue to maintain that the Church of England is a home for Anglicans of varying theological perspectives and that they want that home to include conservatives (although their actions sometimes seem to belie that expressed desire). This is where the question of provision arises for those who disagree with the women bishops measure. Who determines what that provision will look like? The current debate has shown that there is no agreement on that question. The conservatives want more, and the mainline want them to be happy with less.</p>
<p>This is a rift that is unlikely to be healed. Those who say that our divisions hurt our witness in the world, regardless of what the issue is, are correct. All they see is our constant infighting and desperate attempts to hold something together which simply cannot be held together. Jesus commands us to be united (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2017.20-23&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">John 17:20-23</a>), but this is not the type of unity he had in mind.</p>
<p>With that being said, my fourth observation is to wonder why conservative evangelicals continue to spend (waste?) time fighting a losing battle. The reality is that most already distance  themselves from the institution, and by and large, act independently  from it. So all this time spent trying to preserve the last vestiges of a perceived golden age is just time <em>not</em> spent sharing the gospel, discipling people, and working towards the flourishing of our communities. Ultimately, it is a question of priorities. This is not to say that there are no fights worth fighting, but we need to be discerning about the battles we take up. And in the religious climate we live in, surely the task of bearing witnesses to the risen and ascended Lord Jesus Christ is far more important that playing party poltiics in a broken and fragmented institution.</p>
<p>Finally, then, and in all honesty, I do not think conservative evangelicals have a future in the current Church of England. Working for reform from within is an effort that, while perhaps commendable, will ultimately come to naught. The current nature of the institution &ndash; a body united not on theological conviction nor ecclesial practice nor mission and vision, but on a desire to make (almost) everyone happy &ndash; will not permit such reform. Without a solid foundation to build on, nothing will be accomplished. In general, I think conservative evangelicals are too optimistic about what can be accomplished in the context they find themselves in.</p>
<p>As I see it, then, conservative evangelicals only have two options (and this is probably true of other conservatives as well, of the Anglo-Catholic variety). The first is to simply accept the nature of the institution and quietly take their place within it. As a minority, the institution may make some concessions to appease them, but on the whole, continued existence within the institution means conservatives will just have to try to maintain themselves in the face of growing opposition. Admittedly, their numbers are growing, but it will be a long time before they make up a large enough segment to have the kind of clout they need to carry out their desired reforms.</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: 7px 1px 0px 20px; width: 450px; height: 298px;"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/village%20church.jpg" /></div>
<p>The other option, at least for those who are truly concerned to be Anglicans, is to go the way conservative evangelical Anglicans have gone in places like North America and to break away from the existing institutions and form new structures, which are united on matters of theology and practice and mission. Here in the UK, that kind of talk raises a lot of eyebrows and is met with a great deal of opposition, but I think that, in the end, it is the only option for those who are truly concerned to be able to give full expression to biblical and traditional Anglicanism. In many ways this is a sad and unfortunate reality. But there are positives as well &ndash; one only need to look to the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net" target="_blank">Anglican Church in North America</a> and <a href="http://anglican1000.org/" target="_blank">its vision of planting 1000 congregations</a> in the next couple of decades. That is an exciting work that cannot be done when you are focused on maintaining your place in a crumbling institution.</p>
<p>For those who are less concerned about their Anglican identity, the <a href="http://www.fiec.org.uk/" target="_blank">FIEC</a> has indicated that <a href="http://www.john-stevens.com/2012/11/answering-paul-levy-where-are-all.html" target="_blank">it is happy to welcome churches into their fellowship</a>, and I'm sure bodies like the <a href="http://www.ipc-ealing.co.uk/denomination.html" target="_blank">International Presbyterian Church</a> would extend the same invitation. Certainly, there are advantages to being a part of the Church of England, but there comes a point when we need to weigh up our convictions against those advantages and have some serious conversations about the future.</p>
<p>As I say all of this, I realise that I may sound as if I want to see the Church of England broken up. I genuinely don't. I hate division as much as the next person, and I would love to see a wave of reform pass through the institution and to see a recommitment to doing the work of spreading the gospel and faithfully bearing witness to our Lord Jesus Christ. But I am also a realist, and though I have not been within the walls of the Church of England for long, I find myself increasingly sceptical about its future. Division will come at some point, and probably sooner than we think. What that will look like, I don't know. The one clear thing, however, is that the institution cannot continue to exist as it does for much longer. For that reason, I would encourage my conservative evangelical brothers and sisters to begin sitting down now and having those serious conversations that need to be had.</p>

In the end, I anticipate that the women bishops measure will pass at Synod next week. But whatever the outcome, as conservative evangelicals, let's just get on with the business of proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ. That's what we're here for.
