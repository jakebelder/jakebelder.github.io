<p>Some years ago, I was a part of a pastoral search committee at a church I belonged to. It was a small church plant in a very un-churched part of the city, relatively young, and we were looking for a pastor to lead the church forward. One of the conversations we had as we thought about the mission and vision of the church was, who is worship for? That is, were our worship services going to be oriented towards reaching out to unbelievers, or was worship going to be for the equipping and nourishing of believers?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Willimon" target="_blank">William Willimon</a> addresses this question in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0687045320/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0687045320" target="_blank"><em>Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry</em></a>, where he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
When contemporary Christian worship worries about communicating with the secular, unformed, and uninformed seeker, or the casual participant, the result is usually to adapt and to change worship. Such adaptation claims to be based in a concern for evangelism, to reach out to the unchurched. Although a passion for reaching the unchurched is an essential aspect of faithfulness to the gospel, evangelism can have a negative impact upon the fidelity of the church's worship when evangelism becomes the main test of worship. We would do better to concern ourselves that our worship focuses upon God; to worry that our modes of praise arise out of the peculiar quality of the God named Trinity. Rather than change our worship to suit the limitations of contemporary secular people, we would do better to convert contemporary secular people &ndash; to fit them for the arduous yet usually quite joyful task of worshipping the God of Israel and the church.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Robert W. Brimlow says that in our evangelistic witness, our problem 'is <em>not</em> that of finding a way to translate the gospel so that pagans can understand it in their idiom... Rather, our problem as church is to find a way to let the world know that there is another language and another way of viewing and understanding reality that they should want to learn.'
</blockquote>
<p>In one sense, then, the question is a false dichotomy. Worship is ultimately about and for God. But in another sense, the answer is that worship is for both believers and unbelievers. Worship is designed to serve the same purpose for both; as Willimon says, it holds forth an alternative way of viewing and understanding reality. As unbelievers come, they are introduced to this new world, and will feel very aware that something foreign is going on which they stand outside of. As believers come, they are reminded of this new reality they live in, and strengthened and equipped to continue living in the world they have entered into through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

We could say, then, that worship is for everyone. Worship imposes upon us a whole new world. And those who come to worship should desire to be shaped by this reality,  and prepared and equipped to live in this new world where the Triune God  stands at the centre.
