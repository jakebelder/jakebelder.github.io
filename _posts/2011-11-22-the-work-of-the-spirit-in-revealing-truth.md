David Jackman, in his book, Spirit of Truth, writes of the Holy Spirit's work in opening our hearts and minds to the truth:

<blockquote>
He does not reveal new truth, but leads us into the whole truth which is already set forth in Jesus, above whom there could be no fuller revelation of God's truth.<br><br>

The Holy Spirit does not set us free to wander into new realms of 'revelation', secretly given or privately received. For the power of the Spirit is not revealed in secret, mystical messages given to a few super-spiritual people. His power is seen in the proclamation of Jesus Christ as the way, the truth and the life.
</blockquote>

Just as Jesus says in John 14:26, "But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you."
