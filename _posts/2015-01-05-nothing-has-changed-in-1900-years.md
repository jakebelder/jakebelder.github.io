Jesus famously said to his disciples in John 13:35, 'By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.’ You do not need to spend much time in Christian circles before you hear those words employed. The point is simple: when the world sees us living in peace and harmony with one another, it reflects something of the beauty of life as it was meant to be lived, and has a magnetic attraction that draws people in to find the source of this life.

The problem, of course, is that far too often we fail to love one another, and our strife and disunity, whether between individual Christians, or between churches and denominations, absolutely cripples our witness in the world. This is not a new problem. Around 1900 years ago, we find this in [Second Clement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Epistle_of_Clement), one of the writings of the [Apostolic Fathers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Fathers):

<blockquote>
For the Lord says, ‘My name is continually blasphemed among all the nations,’ and again, ‘Woe to him on whose account my name is blasphemed.’ Why is it blasphemed? Because you do not do what I desire. For when the pagans hear from our mouths the oracles of God, they marvel at their beauty and greatness. But when they discover that our actions are not worthy of the words we speak, they turn from wonder to blasphemy, saying that is a myth and a delusion. For when they hear from us that God says, ‘It is no credit to you if you love those who love you, but it is a credit to you if you love your enemies and those who hate you,’ when they hear these things, they marvel at such extraordinary goodness. But when they see that we not only do not love those who hate us but do not even love those who love us, they scornfully laugh at us, and the Name is blasphemed (13:2-4).
</blockquote>

These are strong words, but notice the severe warning in the second line: ‘Woe to him on whose account my name is blasphemed.’ The author of Second Clement is building on Isaiah 52:5, where God says that it was because of Israel’s unfaithfulness that his name was blasphemed by the nations who took them into exile. The author’s point is that we bear personal responsibility for those who are turned away from coming to Christ because of our poor witness. That is a terrifying thought. And that is why most of Second Clement is filled with urgent calls for the church to repent and to reconcile with one another.

Although I think a lot of good work has been done in the last century or so to reawaken us to the way our disunity and lack of love for one another hinders our witness, I have never heard anyone speak as clearly as the author of Second Clement of the responsibility we bear for those who are turned away from Christianity because of us. There is good reason, then, to read this letter, because that is a reality we need to be confronted with. And it should drive us to earnest repentance both for the sake of the world, and for the glory of God.
