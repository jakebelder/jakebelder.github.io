<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted the following Monday. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of May together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>May 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3201/forgotten-places"><strong>Forgotten Places</strong></a> &ndash; The folks at <em><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment">Comment</a> </em>magazine asked me to write an article on 'forgotten places' &ndash; small towns, rural areas, and occasionally cities that lie beyond our periphery. I focus particularly on why we need to be equipping Christians to live faithfully in these contexts as well, and why this focus should not be reserved only for influential urban centres.</li>
<li><a href="http://stevebishop.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/tim-keller-on-sermon-preparation.html"><strong>Tim Keller on sermon preparation</strong></a> &ndash; Steve Bishop posts this short video of Keller talking about how he divides up his time preparing for a sermon. It's very interesting to hear how he tackles this task.</li>
<li><a href="http://antony-billington.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/martin-luther-on-changing-nappies.html"><strong>Martin Luther on Changing Nappies</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://antony-billington.blogspot.co.uk">Antony Billington</a> posts a brilliant quote from Luther on how our faith impacts how we do even the most mundane of tasks. It's a perspective we all need.</li>
<li><a href="http://kuyper.ptsem.edu/"><strong>Digital Library of Abraham Kuyper</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.ptsem.edu">Princeton Theological Seminary</a> has made most of Abraham Kuyper's works available online for free. If you've not read Kuyper yet, it just became very easy to do so. Browse through the collection and start reading.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/05/02/the-most-boring-important-thinker-you-should-read/"><strong>The Most Boring Important Thinker You Should Read</strong></a> &ndash; An interesting post on why you should read Cornelius Van Til, with some helpful suggestions on where to start. I'd also highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0875526659/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0875526659">John Muether's biography of Van Til</a>, which is a great introduction to the man and his thought.</li>
<li><a href="http://krishk.com/2012/05/questions-adoptive-family-through/"><strong>Questions that every adoptive family needs to think through</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://krishk.com">Krish Kandiah</a> has been working for some time now on a project to make fostering and adoption a significant concern of the church, and he's been in California this week at a summit to talk about these things. One of the speakers raised ten very important questions for families wanting to adopt to think about.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/22031635"><strong>Portrait of a City</strong></a> &ndash; I really enjoyed this promotional film made about my hometown, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, in the late 1940s. In typical post-war fashion, all it's qualities are greatly embellished. But it's an interesting look into the city during that time.</li>
<li><a href="http://forsclavigera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/confessions-generations-and-future-of.html"><strong>Confessions, Generations, and the Future of the CRC</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">James K.A. Smith</a> wrote this post in response to a <a href="http://www.thebanner.org/departments/article/?id=4184">recent editorial</a> in the denominational magazine of the <a href="http://www.crcna.org">Christian Reformed Church</a>, <em>The Banner</em>. I was born and raised in the CRC, and so this really hits home for me. Smith is right in his analysis of the problem, and his point that the CRC must recover its committment to historic Reformed orthodoxy is also <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/crc_identity.pdf">what I argued in a paper I wrote in seminary</a>. In many ways I feel that, should the denomination shed the liberalism that has crept in, the CRC would have the most to offer of all Reformed demoninations in North America.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/themes/muddy/pdfs/Worship_2.pdf"><strong>The history of worship from Constantine to the Reformation [PDF]</strong></a> &ndash; <em><a href="http://www.christianhistorymagazine.org">Christian History Magazine</a> </em>has published a special on the history of Christian worship, which looks to be quite interesting. It's available for free as a PDF.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/41782945"><strong>N.T. Wright Sings Bob Dylan</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/">The Rabbit Room</a> in Nashville invitied Wright to speak to a small gathering, and they got a bonus when he put on a bit of a concert. In addition to Dylan, he covered songs by <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2012/05/n-t-wright-sings-the-beatles/">The Beatles</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2012/05/n-t-wright-friday-morning/">Sydney Carter</a>. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/is-the-culture-really-the-problem-74261/"><strong>Is 'the Culture' Really the Church's Problem?</strong></a> &ndash; Here is a great interview with Ken Myers on why not culture itself, but instead the culture <em>of the church</em>, is the biggest obstacle to the church's faithfulness. Myers says, "What I mean is, we have reduced the Gospel to an abstract message of  salvation that can be believed without having any necessary consequences  for how we live."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.faithandleadership.com/content/richard-j-mouw-congregants-long-for-pastors-understand-their-work-lives"><strong>Congregants long for pastors to understand their work lives</strong></a> &ndash; Richard Mouw recalls a conversation with a man who said, &ldquo;My pastor has no idea of the kind of world I live in 6 days a week," and goes on to speak of the importance of discipling people to understand how to approach their vocations as Christians.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dioceseofyork.org.uk/news-events/news/news-from-the-diocese-of-york/01922.html">Hull church helps people struggling with debt</a></strong> &ndash;&nbsp; Part of my responsibilities here at the church are developing and coordinating our community outreach work, and the project featured in this article on the Diocese of York's website is one we've been working on for a couple of years. The photo at the top of this post is from the article.</li>
<li><a href="http://forsclavigera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/engagement-with-two-kingdoms-thought.html"><strong>An Engagement with "Two Kingdoms" Thought</strong></a> &ndash; Though I've not given space specifically to critiquing the 'two kingdoms' camp of the Reformed tradition, I do think it has some significant problems and is a departure from historic Reformed theology. James K.A. Smith has written an article for the most recent issue of the <em>Calvin Theological Journal</em> engaging the issue, which promises to be a very interesting read.</li>
<li><a href="http://markrglanville.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/gods-judgement-an-exclusivist-outrage-or-the-end-of-oppression/"><strong>God's judgement: an exclusivist outrage or the end of oppression?</strong></a> &ndash; Mark Glanville writes on why God's judgement is necessary if we are to have hope. He says, "Judgement then is a central part of the hope that we have in Christ.  The future of the world is safe in its creator&rsquo;s hands. He loved the  world to life in creation and he will love it to life again."</li>
<li><a href="http://religionandpolitics.org/2012/05/01/john-stott-c-s-lewis-j-r-r-tolkien-why-american-evangelicals-love-the-british/?single=1"><strong>Why American Evangelicals Love the British</strong></a> &ndash; This was a rather curious piece. I felt like the author's argument was lacking in many respects. For one, I didn't feel that she even proved the point she set out to make. Additionally, she makes no mention of N.T. Wright, who has had quite an impact on American evangelicalism. On the whole, it's unconvincing and demonstrates quite an ignorance of evangelicalism as a whole.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3251/a-letter-to-my-daughter-upon-her-graduation-from-christian-school"><strong>A Letter to my Daughter, Upon her Graduation from Christian School</strong></a> &ndash; An absolutely wonderful piece, in which Glenn Oeland clearly lays out the <em>raison </em><span class="st"><em>d'&ecirc;tre</em> for Christian schools. It</span> nicely encapsulates all the reasons I am such a proponent of Christian education. My hope is that many Christian parents would read this article and commit themselves fully to providing Christian education for their children and for future generations.<span class="st"><br /></span></li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2012/05/uncommon-decency/"><strong>Truth, gentleness, and convicted civility</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://tjhoiland.com">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> has been reading <a href="http://www.fuller.edu/academics/faculty/richard-mouw.aspx">Richard Mouw's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830833099/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0830833099"><em>Uncommon Decency: Christian Civility in an Uncivil World</em></a>, and pulls out Mouw's main points in this review. Really getting to the heart of why civility is so important, Tim writes, "To speak about our hope harshly or disrespectfully distorts the gospel into something coercive, something ugly."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQf-PZWFMzY"><strong>Epic time-lapse map of Europe</strong></a> &ndash; Anyone who knows even a little history will know that the borders of Europe have changed many times throughout history. This animated map shows just how many changes they've undergone between the year 1000 and the present.<a class="twitter-anywhere-user" href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged"></a> It's pretty wild. (via <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/">Alastair Roberts</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/coffee-drinkers-may-live-longer/"><strong>Coffee Drinkers May Live Longer</strong></a> &ndash; What a good God we have. He blesses those who enjoy the good gifts of his creation!</li>
<li><a href="http://krishk.com/2012/05/lets-make-a-difference/"><strong>Let's make a difference</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://krishk.com">Krish Kandiah</a> talks about how the church in the UK can make a massive difference by committing to fostering and adoption. Check out the short video in the post if you think it's a daunting task; the maths demonstrate otherwise!

<li><a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html"><strong>If Christ is Lord, Everything Matters</strong></a> &ndash; The folks at <a href="http://www.oncallinculture.com/">On Call in Culture</a> asked me to write this post in response to a short Twitter conversation  (the background is spelled out at the beginning of the post). I explore  the creation, fall, redemption paradigm and how that shapes our life in  this world, concluding that our task consists in "demonstrating what  all of life looks like under the rule of Christ and  resolutely  [refusing] to allow Satan to have mastery over anything good that  God  has made."</li>
<li><a href="http://krishk.com/2012/05/issues-facing-evangelicals-today/"><strong>Issues facing Evangelicals Today</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://krishk.com">Krish Kandiah's</a> blog is always good for some thought-provoking material, and this one  is no different. He compiles an interesting list of challenges and  opportunities for the church, the former including an uncertainty about  the definition of the gospel and a sense of tribalism, the latter  including more churches trying to be holistic in their mission.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18149510"><strong>Childhood 'screen time': Warning over TV and computers</strong></a> &ndash; The BBC News ran this article a few days ago on why children need to  spend less time in front of the TV. I found this a bit laughable, since  anyone with a bit of common sense already knows this. The suggestions in  the article may be a bit extreme, but Mozart didn't write his first  symphony at the age of eight while spending six hours a day in front of  the TV.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.faith-theology.com/2012/05/psalms-for-all-seasons-contemporary.html"><strong>Psalms for all seasons: a contemporary psalter</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.faith-theology.com">Ben Myers</a> talks about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1587433168/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1587433168">a new psalter that's recently been released</a>, and continues with some great reflections on why we need to recover the practice of singing the Psalms in worship.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/05/21/sermon-prep-a-week-in-one-life/"><strong>Sermon Prep: A Week in One Life</strong></a> &ndash; It's always interesting to hear other pastors talk about how they  structure their sermon preparation. This post is by Stephen Um of <a href="http://citylifeboston.org/">Citylife Presbyterian Church</a> in Boston.</li>
<li><a href="http://byfaithonline.com/page/in-the-church/redefining-the-parish-model-an-old-concept-finds-revival-within-the-pca"><strong>Redefining the Parish Model: An Old Concept Find Revival Within the PCA</strong></a> &ndash; This is an interesting article on how the <a href="http://www.pcanet.org">Presbyterian Church in America</a>,  a denomination I was involved with for some time, is recovering the  practice of parish ministry. The article has a few stories from places  where they are putting this into practice, and demonstrates the benefits  of a truly local church ministry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2114386_2114388_2115566,00.html"><strong>86 Surprising Facts About Queen Elizabeth II</strong></a> &ndash; An interesting list of trivia about the Queen.</li>
<li><a href="http://bibleandmission.redcliffe.org/resources/bible-and-mission-books/"><strong>Bible and Mission books and articles</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://bibleandmission.redcliffe.org/about/">The Centre for the Study of Bible and Mission</a>, connected with <a href="http://www.redcliffe.org/">Redcliffe College</a>, has a helpful list of resources here on that subject. Many of them are available for free.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/05/my-solution-to-the-same-sex-marriage-debate-with-an-ecclesiology-of-exile/"><strong>My Solution to the Same-Sex Marriage Debate, with an Ecclesiology of Exile</strong></a> &ndash; A very interesting post here from <a href="http://twitter.com/mbird12">Mike Bird</a>. On the whole, I think I'm sympathetic with his view. I certainly favour the idea of taking marriage out of the hands of the state and making the legal union they grant simply a civil union. His notion of an ecclesiology of exile is also helpful and worth thinking about.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/blog/2012/05/life-lessons-in-cultural-engagement/"><strong>Life Lessons in Cultural Engagement</strong></a> &ndash; A new intern at <a href="http://www.cardus.ca">Cardus</a>, John Sikkema, writes, "Christians, even those active in the 'public square,' seem to have settled for a mandate of <em>preservation</em> rather than <em>domination</em>. What happened to boldly declaring the dominion of Christ over every inch of the Dominion of Canada?" (or any nation, for that matter).</li>
<li><a href="http://emilygent.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/thoughts-on-women-bishops-debate.html?m=0"><strong>Thoughts on the 'Women Bishops' debate...</strong></a> &ndash; Emily Gent, a brand-new blogger and ordinand in the Church of England, writes of how troubling she finds the tone of debate over the matter of women bishops, lamenting the bitterness and resentment on both sides of the argument. A very refreshing perspective.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.faith-theology.com/2012/05/berlin-notebook-on-german-sentences.html"><strong>Berlin notebook: on German sentences</strong></a> &ndash; A brilliant post from <a href="http://twitter.com/FaithTheology">Ben Myers</a> on how English is the language of real conversation. He writes, "English is without rival as the world's great  language of magnanimous interruption. English is the language of dialogue &ndash; that haphazard rambunctious teemingly unpredictable grand good stuff of human speech."</li>
