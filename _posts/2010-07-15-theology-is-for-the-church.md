<p><a href="http://www3.ptsem.edu/Content.aspx?id=1918&amp;menu_id=72">Ellen Charry</a>, professor of systematic theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, wrote a book&nbsp;about a decade ago called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Renewing-Your-Minds-Pastoral-Christian/dp/0195134869/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1279221874&amp;sr=1-3">By the Renewing of Your Minds: The Pastoral Function of Christian Doctrine</a></em>. She argues, using the example of some of the most significant theologians in history, that theology must be done first and foremost for the service of the church. Theology is a key component of discipleship and&nbsp;an essential part of growth in faith. In a chapter on the Swiss reformer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin">John Calvin</a>, she notes:</p>
<blockquote>
[Calvin] was concerned with engaging Christians in understanding God deeply and personally...he believed that Christians need moral strengthening and that God is the proper agent of reform. Training in godliness is the purpose of his <em><a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.titlepage.html">Institutes of the Christian Religion</a></em>, stated in the opening paragraph of his prefatory address to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France">King Francis I</a>, which accompanied the first (1536) edition: 'My purpose was solely to transmit certain rudiments by which those who are touched with any zeal for religion might be shaped to true godliness'... And in the prefatory note to the final (1559) edition, Calvin repeats that he had 'no other purpose than to benefit the church by maintaining the pure doctrine of godliness' through his 'zeal to spread [God's] Kingdom and to further the public good'... Calvin begins by identifying himself as an aretegenically oriented teacher of the church who understands the implications of theology for public life.<br><br>

If we take doctrine and piety as belonging to two separate fields, one academic and the other pastoral, we will never understand Calvin. For Calvin, the purpose of treating articles of religion is to enhance godliness. If that treatment is comprehensive, so much the better. The modern academy eliminated spiritual and moral formation from scholarly inquiry, rendering the modern disciplines of marginal use to the church. Calvin would stand down from this decision (199).
</blockquote>
<p>Calvin's perspective here (and, by extension, Charry's)&nbsp;is the reason I maintain such an interest in theology. While one can certainly study theology at an academic level, that person then has a responsibility &ndash; indeed, a duty &ndash; to use the fruits of that study in service of the church and for the building up of the body of Christ. I <a href="http://jakebelder.com/christian-scholars-as-public-intellectuals">noted last year </a>how Jamie Smith makes this same contention, and was reminded of his words again today as I was reading this portion of Charry's book. One of my professors at RTS, <a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=502">John Frame</a>, would frequently <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-importance-of-theology-i">make the same observation</a>. His defintion of theology as "the application of God's Word by persons to all areas of life" makes the point explicitly. It's not just intended for the ivory tower of the academy.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I find it odd that given Calvin's perspective on theology, we treat the <em>Institutes</em> as some sort of rigorously academic textbook, when instead Calvin intended it for the people in his congregation, as a means to help them understand the Bible more fully, and thus as a tool for discipleship.)</p>

The church <em>needs</em> theology, there is no getting around it. Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples by teaching them <em>all</em> that he had commanded them. Growth in faith correlates with a growth in knowledge. Theologians, do your work for the service of the church that God's people might increasingly learn to live for his glory.
