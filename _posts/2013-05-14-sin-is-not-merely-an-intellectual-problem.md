Smith](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) challenges what he calls an 'intellectualist' understanding of sin, arguing instead that sin is rooted in something that goes much deeper. I find this to be particularly helpful:

<blockquote>
We [need to] resist merely 'intellectualist' accounts of sin, temptation, and malformation, which are problematic on two levels. First, intellectualist accounts of sin mistakenly see <em>all</em> action as the outcome of conscious, deliberative <em>choices</em>, unaware of the dynamics of formation and habituation... For the intellectualist, every sin is a deliberate choice based on either false beliefs or a lack of knowledge. To be 'tempted', on this account, is always to <em>believe</em> a lie. So the corrective for sinful action would be <em>knowledge</em>: true beliefs and adequate knowledge to equip the person to make better choices. Second, and as a result, intellectualist accounts tend to be blithely unaware of the social forces and systemic factors that prime and shape our imaginations, creating dispositions and tendencies within us toward unjust action and sinful behavior. This is why intellectualist accounts also tend to be highly individualist accounts. We might say that an intellectualist model is able to register only discrete sinful <em>actions</em> but is unable to account for a sinful <em>way of life</em> – the rhythms and habits and routines that disorder a people or a culture in ways that run counter to what God envisions for creation.<br><br>

...Much of our action is not the fruit of conscious deliberation but is rather the outcome of an acquired, habituated disposition. So the same must be true of our <em>sinful</em>, disordered action. That doesn't mean we're not responsible...rather, the point is that we become habituated to ways of life that run counter to what God envisions for the flourishing of creation. By the quiet, unconscious operation of liturgical formation, we are unwittingly conscripted into stories that are rival tellings of what's in store for the world. These narratives and their metaphorical power seep into our bones in such a way that they come to dominate our 'background' and thus begin to shape our very perception of the world – which, in turn, orients and governs our (habitual) action. We absorb rival gospels as <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_%28sociology%29">habitus</em></a>, and thus act 'toward' them, as it were – pulled toward a different <em>telos</em> that rivals the coming kingdom of God. (140-141)
</blockquote>

The corrective, as Smith suggests, is not merely the acquisition of knowledge, but it is a deep-seated transformation at the level of the heart. We need to have our loves and desires re-formed and rightly ordered, shaped by the true story of Scripture. And the way to do that, he argues, is through worship.
