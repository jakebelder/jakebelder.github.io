Interesting discussion today in class on the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. We began by talking about the nature of the Sabbath. D.A. Carson argues that the Sabbath was abrogated with Christ’s fulfillment of the law, and we now have the Lord’s Day, which he distinguishes as different. He is contrasted by the former Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, who maintained that while the day is different, the Sabbath remains. Carson says that as we are on the other side of the crux of redemptive history (Christ’s death and resurrection), we must now view it in a different light.

This is where it gets interesting. Some say that as we live in the already/not yet mentality---that is, in this stage of the coming of the Kingdom where it has been established by Christ, but not yet consummated by his second coming---we need to view the Lord’s Day in this manner as well. The rest that we observe on the Lord’s Day is a foretaste of the eternal rest that we will have when the Kingdom comes in fullness. As such, we should not require unbelievers to observe the Sabbath. Thus, if they want to have their stores and restaurants open on Sunday, if they want to work on Sunday, let them do so.

That is a peculiar line of thought to me, and one that I have not come into contact with up until now. As I've understood it (according to Calvin's threefold division of the law), all people are bound to the moral law, due to the fact that we are in covenant with God. The Sabbath, though a creation ordinance like marriage and work, is distinguished by the fact that it is eschatological in nature. So it is reserved for believers only.

I'll have one more post on this for sure, maybe more. But for now, any thoughts on this? Is this a new understanding for you?
