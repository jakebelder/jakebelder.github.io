<p>The area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> is characteristically one of the areas of the United States where the gospel is least present.  It appears that this is historically the case as well, as is illustrated in a letter between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28theologian%29">Jonathan Edwards</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield">George Whitefield</a> in February of 1740.  Edwards, in requesting Whitefield to visit his church at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton%2C_Massachusetts">Northampton</a>, makes these observations (quoted in <em>Jonathan Edwards: A Guided Tour of His Life and Thought</em>, by Stephen J. Nichols):</p>
<blockquote>Indeed I am fearful whether you will not be disappointed in New England, and have less success here than in other places: we who have dwelt in a land that has been distinguished with light, and have long enjoyed the gospel, and have been glutted with it, and have despised it, are I fear more hardened than most of those places where you have preached hitherto (55).</blockquote>
