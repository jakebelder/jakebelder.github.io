<p>The other day, I was perusing some notes from one of my systematic theology classes in seminary, and I came across some observations that <a href="http://www.rts.edu/Seminary/Faculty/bio.aspx?id=403" target="_blank">Scott Swain</a>, one of my professors, had made regarding our slavery to sin and slavery to righteousness. I thought it quite helpful, and worth sharing.</p>
<p>Most Christians are well acquainted with the Bible's usage of the language of slavery when talking about humanity's relation to sin. We are by nature in bondage to a 'master' who seeks total control over us. Because of the work of Christ, though, we rejoice in our deliverance from this slavery. A<span style="font-size: 100%;">s a consequence of  our justification, we are objectively transferred to a new estate, now 'slaves' to Christ, under His Lordship (cf. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%206:17-18;&amp;version=31;">Rom. 6:17-18</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:13;&amp;version=47;">Col. 1:13</a>). This is hardly to be considered slavery, of course, because this servitude is a joyful state we gladly enter into as our hearts compel us, out of love and thankfulness for what Jesus  has done, to devote our whole being to Him.</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless,  despite our new state of being slaves to Christ, believers can  still subject themselves to the slavery of sin (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%206:16;&amp;version=47;">Rom. 6:16</a>).   There is something profoundly tragic about this.  Before our  justification through Christ, we were slaves to sin on account of our  natural state of depravity.  Now, having been purchased through the blood  of Jesus, we become slaves to Him.  Yet, though he welcomes us into a state of  righteousness with open arms, we continue to  opt to be slaves to the prince of darkness.  It is because this slavery is not 'rightful' that it is all the more tragic.</p>
<p>The tragedy of this illegitimate slavery should impel us all the more to say with confidence that this day we will choose to serve the Lord (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=josh%2024:15&amp;version=47;">Josh. 24:15</a>). He is our only rightful master, and because he is our creator and redeemer, we owe him everything. The paradox of this slavery, of course, is that it is actually the only place true freedom is found. More, because he is our covenant Lord, he has bound himself to bless his people, and so those who are bound to him will one day receive the fulness of life and be welcomed into perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ.</p>
