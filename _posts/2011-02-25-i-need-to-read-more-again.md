<p>Some time ago, I packed up a lot of the books on my shelves in anticipation of our upcoming move. Robin and I figured that we could get a head start on preparations by packing up some of our non-essentials. Since I didn't plan on using <em>all </em>of my books, I picked up a handful to read over the coming months, and put the rest in boxes in our office. On the shelf in the photo to the left, I lined up the books I wanted to read, and started to dive into them (the number of books on this shelf has nearly doubled since then, thanks to some new purchases, and I don't intend to read all the books on the shelf there anymore).</p>
<p>While I have gotten through a few of them, overall I haven't gotten very far. If you pay any attention to the little Goodreads widget on the sidebar of this blog, you'll notice that it hasn't changed very often. After I finished seminary last May, I decided that I needed a bit of a break, and so I took up reading a bit of literature and some other things that did not require a great deal of mental energy. Before long, though, I found that I was not reading very much at all, and now I am at the point where I am finding it a bit difficult to get back into it.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of excuses I could make, of course, and some of them are legitimate. Up until about a month ago I was working well over sixty hours a week, and that took away a great deal of my time. Others are not so legitimate, such as wasting time browsing through photo albums on Facebook. Either way, I have come to find that it is not as easy as it once was to sit down and so some sustained reading.</p>
<p>My to-read shelf contains what I think will be some very interesting reads. In the summer, I started to read Harvie Conn and Manuel Ortiz's <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/6824/nm/Urban+Ministry:+The+Kingdom,+the+City+and+the+People+of+God+(Paperback)?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Urban Ministry: The Kingdom, the City, and the People of God</a></em>, because one of the main responsibilities I will have in the role I'll eventually be taking up at St John's Church in Hull is to find ways in which the church can minister to the city. I didn't get too far in the book, but Conn and Ortiz's exploration of the role of the city in the Old and New Testaments was fascinating, and I'm not sure why I ever put it down. I made my way through a few of the essays in Herman Bavinck's <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5633/nm/Essays+on+Religion,+Science,+and+Society+(Hardcover)?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Essays on Religion, Science, and Society</a></em>, and although they were quite intellectually challenging, they are all marked with Bavinck's characteristic erudition, wisdom, and pastoral sensitivity. There are also a few books up there that I have read in the past but wanted to read again &ndash; Martin Lloyd-Jones' <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/213/nm/Preaching+and+Preachers?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Preaching and Preachers</a></em>, Al Wolters' <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/4249/nm/Creation+Regained:+Biblical+Basics+for+a+Reformational+Worldview,+2nd+Edition+(Paperback)?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview</a></em>, and Mike Goheen and Craig Bartholomew's <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/3687/nm/Drama+of+Scripture:+Finding+Our+Place+in+the+Biblical+Story?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">The Drama of Scripture: Finding Our Place in the Biblical Story</a>&nbsp;</em>(which I originally read in draft form in college while they were still making final revisions to it), to name a few. I added a few new volumes recently that I want to get into as well, such as a recent book by one of my university professors, James Payton, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Reformation-Wrong-Correcting-Misunderstandings/dp/0830838805">Getting the Reformation Wrong: Correcting Some Misunderstandings</a></em>, and another by one of my seminary professors, John Frame, <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/7264/nm/The+Doctrine+of+the+Word+of+God+(A+Theology+of+Lordship+Volume+4)+(Hardcover)?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">The Doctrine of the Word of God</a>. </em>Not yet on the shelf is Jamie Smith's little book, <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/7191/nm/Letters+to+a+Young+Calvinist:+An+Invitation+to+the+Reformed+Tradition+(Paperback)?utm_source=jbelder&amp;utm_medium=blogpartners">Letters to a Young Calvinist: An Invitation to the Reformed Tradition</a> </em>&ndash; the bookstore was out of it when I went over there a few days ago &ndash; but that is another I plan on reading when I get my hands on a copy.</p>
<p>I can't make many excuses about the lack of time anymore, since my hours have been cut back quite a bit. Now it is just a matter of getting back into the habit of reading. I need to regain my focus, to be able to sit down and read for an extended period of time. There are any number of distractions when I try to do this, but I need to find a way to ignore them and focus. Oddly, I have found that some of my best reading has happened in places like a coffee shop, where there is lots of activity and noise around me. But I can't afford to spend an hour in Starbucks every night just so I can get some reading done.</p>

This turned into a far longer post than I imagined it would, so let me end by asking, are there any tips or suggestions you have when it comes to reading? What helps keep you focused?
