<p><a href="http://journeytoorthodoxy.com/2010/10/28/why-orthodox-men-love-church/#axzz1goXqU6GW">Orthodox men love church</a>, says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederica_Mathewes-Green">Frederica Matthewes-Green</a>. A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled across an article she had written after dialoguing with one hundred Orthodox men who had converted to Orthodoxy as adults to find out what drew them in.</p>
<p>It's no secret that in most Protestant churches, females make up a larger portion of the congregation, often significantly. This was one of the reasons Matthewes-Green decided to find out why Orthodoxy bucks that trend. What she discovered was very interesting. Look at some of the responses below. It is especially noteworthy, I think, that many of the men commented on the challenge of Orthodoxy:</p>
<blockquote>
"It's the only church where you are required to adapt to it, rather than it adapting  to you."<br><br>
"Orthodoxy is serious. It is difficult. It is demanding. It is about  mercy, but it's  also about overcoming oneself. I am challenged in a   deep way, not to 'feel good about myself' but to become  holy. It is  rigorous, and in that rigour I find  liberation."<br><br>
"Guys either want to be challenged to fight for a   glorious and  honourable cause, and get filthy dirty in the  process, or  to loaf in  our recliners with plenty of beer,  pizza, and football. But  most  churches want us to behave  like orderly gentlemen, keeping our  hands  and mouths nice  and clean."<br><br>
"Christ in Orthodoxy is a militant, Jesus takes Hell captive. Orthodox Jesus came to cast fire on the earth. In Holy Baptism we pray for the newly-enlisted warriors of Christ, male and female, that they may &lsquo;be kept ever warriors invincible.'"<br><br>
"...&lsquo;the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay&rsquo; has almost nothing to do with the Eternal Logos entering inexorably, silently yet heroically, into the fabric of created reality."<br><br>
"Men get pretty cynical when they sense someone's   attempting to  manipulate their emotions, especially when  it's in the  name of  religion. They appreciate the  objectivity of Orthodox worship.  It's  not aimed at  prompting religious feelings but at performing an    objective duty."
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of the things these men say they like in Orthodoxy could be true of Protestantism as well. The problem, though, is that many churches have changed and have adapted too much to modern culture. But a Protestant church that is true to its heritage and tradition does require you to adapt to it. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/williams-on-the-book-of-common-prayer">I mentioned the Book of Common Prayer the other day</a>; worshipping in a church which uses the BCP presents a challenge that you need to adapt to. Protestant faith is serious and difficult and demanding; Jesus said that if anyone was to follow him they needed to first lay down their life (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Mt16.24-25">Matt. 16:24-25</a>). We are called to be holy too, and learning to submit to Christ's Lordship over all of your life is a difficult process. Early Protestants saw Jesus as a strong and powerful King; the tender, soft Swedish Jesus is a modern invention. Protestant worship isn't about feelings and emotions and it does require participation.</p>
<p>But it's not difficult to see that in many churches this is not the case anymore. So, maybe we need to change something. Maybe it's not about coming up with new ways to challenge men, but returning to more classical forms of faith and worship. Maybe instead of dumbing everything down, we make men wrestle again with words and phrases that take some work to understand. Maybe instead of making worship as comfortable as we can, we make them kneel once in a while or stand for prolonged periods of time. Maybe we get them thinking hard about being disciples of Christ, as workers, as husbands and fathers, as citizens, as sports fans. Maybe we don't allow them to be passive and train them to teach or to lead in prayer or to mentor young men.</p>

Christianity should be hard work. It should be challenging. It requires us, after all, to surrender <em>everything</em> to Christ. If men are not learning that in our churches, then something is wrong.
