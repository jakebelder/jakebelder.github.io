[Paul Avis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Avis) (pictured below), in his book, *[The Anglican Understanding of the Church](http://amzn.to/1zD0cbk)*, notes that the apostolicity of the Church is about the continuity of its mission and message. Apostolicity derives first 'from the mission that the Son receives from the Father and conveys to the Church, together with the gift of the Holy Spirit' (90), and a Church then maintains its apostolicity when it is in continuity with this mission and with the life of the early Christians first entrusted with this mission. Today, apostolicity is manifested both by a Church's ongoing confession of the apostolic faith, and through its ministries and sacraments.

For Avis, it is the mark of apostolicity that is key in determining when you should leave a Church,<sup>1</sup> something he notes in his book, *[The Identity of Anglicanism](http://amzn.to/1vAAyUR)*. Having addressed this question before on this blog [here](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/when-should-you-leave-a-denomination) and [here](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/when-should-you-leave-a-church), as well as finding this to be a significant question in directing my own ecclesiological journey and shaping my thoughts on the unity of the Church, I was interested to read Avis' take on the question. He writes,

<blockquote>
Anyone who has reached this definite position – who believes that their church has forfeited its apostolicity – cannot be expected to remain there… They are the ones who should feel free, in all conscience, to depart in search of a church about whose apostolicity and authenticity as a true church they are assured...<br><br>

Separation from and breaking communion (<em>koinonia</em>) with those with whom we are already in communion cannot be justified on less grounds. A study of the grounds of separation in the New Testament suggests that it is justified only when the fundamental baptismal faith is denied. Only what cuts us off from communion with Father, Son and Holy Spirit can be allowed to cut us off sacramentally from one another. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Chadwick_%28theologian%29">Henry Chadwick</a> has put it: 'To refuse or to withdraw from participation in the sacrament, through which the unity of the Church is effected as a concrete reality, is an exquisitely painful denial of everything we understand to be the Lord’s intention for his people' (143).
</blockquote>

Two thoughts spring from this. First, briefly, whereas Avis remarks that anyone who feels the apostolicity of the Church has been compromised should feel free to leave, I would be more inclined to suggest that it is a matter of (particularly theological) integrity that they actually do leave.

Second, Avis adopts a similar tone to that of [John Frame](http://www.rts.edu/seminary/faculty/bio.aspx?id=502), who I quoted [in my last post on the subject](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/when-should-you-leave-a-denomination), by urging extreme restraint with regards to leaving a Church. The implication again (like Frame too seemed to suggest) is that we remain where we are and to continually work towards reforming our Churches. Of course, there always remains the possibility that we will be kicked out, but to echo my conclusion from last time, unless that happens we must not do anything that would cause any further splintering and division. To do so would be at odds with Christ's will for his Church, and with the biblical pattern for dealing with false teaching.

Our responsibility, then, remains to work towards reform where it is required to ensure that our Churches do not lose the mark of apostolicity, and to do this as we earnestly pray that these efforts will play a part in ultimately re-establishing [the real and tangible unity of the body of Christ](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/making-the-organic-unity-of-the-church-a-reality).

<div class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>Note that Avis is talking about a national organisation of churches, or a denomination. If your local parish church breaks from the apostolic faith, you can go to the next parish. It is quite a different matter if the whole Church officially loses the mark of apostolicity.</div>
