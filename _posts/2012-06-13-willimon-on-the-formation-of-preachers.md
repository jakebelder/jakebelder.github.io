<p>How someone learns to preach is a discussion that has come up a few times on this blog, most recently in response to a tweet about <a href="http://jakebelder.com/tim-keller-got-a-c-in-preaching-class" target="_blank">Tim Keller's grade in a seminary preaching class</a>. The other day, while continuing to work my way through William Willimon's excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0687045320/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0687045320" target="_blank"><em>Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry</em></a>, I came across some thoughts he had on the formation of preachers:</p>
<blockquote>
To be sure, preaching is one of the most demanding and difficult of pastoral tasks. Good preaching requires so wide a range of gifts and skills. It is no wonder that some have asked if it can be taught at all. 'Preachers are born, not made.' Although the natural gifts of the preacher count for much, good preaching is an art, not magic. It must be learned. As with any art, preaching is an alloy of gifts and training, natural inclination and cultivated dispositions. Because preaching is an art, the best methods of homiletical education tend to be modes of apprenticeship &ndash; a novice looking over the shoulder of an experienced master of the art in order to get the insights, moves, and gestures required to practice that art. For this reason, homiletics is often the most difficult practice to teach at a seminary, and often the most poorly learned. Preachers are made through intense engagement between a master and novice &ndash; the master being willing to take the time to get to know the novice, the novice being willing to submit to the moves, habits, and insights of the master. Preaching cannot be learned, as it is often attempted to be taught, with a group of twenty passive seminarians sitting through lectures in a homiletics class, handing in a few written 'sermons' during the course of the semester.</blockquote>
<p>Willimon's perspective seems to strike a good balance on the two sides of this issue. There is a recognition of both natural gifting and the role of more formal training. His emphasis on the significance of mentoring and apprenticeships in forming preachers is especially important, and I think it is worth noting that it models the way Jesus taught his disciples. And, of course, this places the preacher who is being formed in the context of a community of believers, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/preaching-is-best-done-by-pastors" target="_blank">which is essential for the application of the Word</a>.</p>

If you are a preacher, I would be interested in your take on this. What do you think?
