Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>13-19 July 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1l0MvIl">A Call to Adopt</a></strong> – The good people at <a href=“http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation”>The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation, and Culture</a> asked me to write an article on adoption for their blog. It was a good opportunity to reflect again on adopting our children, ten months on from bringing them home.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1rpMsuM">False Steps in the Assisted Dying Debate</a></strong> – A very helpful and incisive piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/goddardaj">Andrew Goddard</a> in response to some poorly argued statements from Christians who have recently come out in favour of assisted suicide.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1yqxmIC">On the Need for Gay Christian Role Models</a></strong> – <a href=“http://twitter.com/wesleyhill”>Wesley Hill</a> shares some thoughts on a key way the church can help celibate gay Christians to live faithfully.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1tU8VEz">Barbara Walters on the Art of Conversation, How to Talk to Bores, and What Truman Capote Teaches Us About Being Interesting</a></strong> – As someone who thoroughly enjoys good conversation (and wishes he was much better at it!) I found this post quite interesting.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1qGTGct">“Great sermon, pastor!” Handling genuine compliments</a></strong> – Here is a helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/Greenfarmhouse">Chris Green</a> on how to handle different types of post-sermon conversations.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1qh5iHf">Church Planting Is Insufficient For Social Change</a></strong> – This is a great post from <a href=“http://twitter.com/drantbradley”>Anthony Bradley</a> on why just planting churches and converting people won't change cities. Christians need to be fully involved in the life of our communities, especially at the institutional level, if we are going to be a blessing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1zQmLsb">On good disagreement and the future of the Church of England</a></strong> – This theme came up last week in a post from Martin Davie, and here <a href=“http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith”>Anthony Smith</a> picks it up again with some thoughtful comments.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1wDN5Bk">Marriage for the Common Good</a></strong> – Here is a great piece from <a href=“http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith”>James K.A. Smith</a> on why marriages cannot be 'privatized enclaves for romance', but must be for the common good. He writes, 'When we expect marriages to be extensions of idealistic weddings, we're not only setting ourselves up to fail, we are abandoning the call to "household," to curate open homes where others are welcome and from which we lean out to serve the good of our neighbours.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1qkdbMb">Christoformity</a></strong> – The whole idea of ‘cruciformity’ has been a somewhat popular idea in recent years, but Peter Leithart here helpfully suggests that we need to talk about more than that.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://blog.bakeracademic.com/video-ecclesiastes-a-book-for-our-time">Ecclesiastes, a Book for Our Time</a></strong> – Craig Bartholomew talks about his new commentary in these two short videos. The second in particular is quite interesting as he talks about his reading of Ecclesiastes and the tradition it most closely aligns with.</li>
