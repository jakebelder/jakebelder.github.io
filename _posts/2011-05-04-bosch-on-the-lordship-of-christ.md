<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bosch">David J. Bosch</a> wrote the following in December 1979 issue of the <em>Journal of Theology for Southern Africa. </em>Bosch, a renowned missiologist, wants us to think about what it means to recognise and acknowledge the Lordship of Christ over all of creation. This is the kind of thing that simply electrifies me.</p>
<blockquote>
As Lord, Jesus was given '<em>all power </em>in heaven and <em>on earth</em>' (Matt. 28:18). He is therefore repeatedly referred to as 'Saviour of the <em>world</em>'  (John 4:42; 1 John 4:14). 'All things were created by him, and all  things exist through him and for him,' says Paul (Rom. 11:36). It is the  purpose of God to bring all creation together, everything in heaven and  on earth, with Christ as head (Eph. 1:10).<br><br>

All this  means that the Kingdom of God (or the Lordship of Christ) is without  boundaries. Christ is Lord of all. Naturally, his Lordship his not yet  openly and finally manifested. The ultimate is yet to come. We live in  the penultimate. We still wait for the day of which Rev. 11:15 speaks,  when, as it affirms 'the kingdoms of this world are to become the  Kingdom of God,' when God 'will be all in all' (1 Cor. 15:28). For the  time being Christ's Lordship over the universe is anonymous; he is not  recognised and acclaimed as Lord.<br><br>

We should,  however, not deduce from this that God has handed the universe over to  the counter-forces. He is not an absentee Lord whose estate is being  ransacked by his enemies during his absence. To be sure, the enemy is  active in God's world, extremely active, but we should never allow  ourselves to accept that this world <em>belongs</em> to the enemy. If  areas of the universe indeed appear to be enemy-occupied territory, let  us never for one moment forget that they are occupied illegally, by a  usurpur. Satan does not <em>belong</em> in this world. The earth is the <em>Lord's</em>. <br><br>

If we  forget this we commit the same mistake as those Christians who  argue...that we had better withdraw from the world into a religious  enclave. The terrible thing these Christians are doing is to grant  legality to the spurious claim of the enemy that this world belongs to  him, not to God! And when Jesus said to Pilate, 'My Kingdom is not of  this world', his words should not be understood as meaning that his  Kingdom is entirely other-worldly. It should rather, within the context  of John's gospel, be understood to mean, 'My Kingdom does not operate  according to the rules of this world which have been adulterated by  Satan. My Kingdom is unique. But this does not make it other-worldly.'  Did Jesus not, after all, teach his disciples to pray, 'Thy Kingdom  come; thy will be done <em>on earth</em> as it is in heaven?' Therefore,  if we Christians surrender this world to Satan, we play right into his  hands. And we betray the Lordship of Christ.

I am signing off for the next couple of weeks, and so during that time I will leave you to draw out the practical implications of Bosch's excellent words. Any comments you have in response would be most welcome. We need to be talking about this since it is so crucial to discipleship and to the church's mission in the world.
