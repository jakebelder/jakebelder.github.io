<p>Henry R. Van Til (the nephew of Cornelius) is often credited with the remarkable insight, "Culture is religion externalized." However, if you read the following portion from the chapter on the relationship of religion and culture in his book, <em><a href="http://www.contra-mundum.org/books/Concept.pdf">The Calvinistic Concept of Culture</a></em>, you will find out that those words are actually a paraphrase of a quote properly attributed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich">Paul Tillich</a>.</p>
<p>At any rate, Van Til makes the crucial point here that our deepest religious convictions penetrate our entire being and form the axis on which our lives rotate. Every human being is a religious being at the very core. Says Van Til,</p>
<blockquote>It is...more correct to ask what the role of culture is in religion than to put the question the other way around, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Faith-Reason-Existence-Introduction-Co/dp/B0012C7XUA">as Hutchison does</a>, 'What is religion's role in culture?' For man, in the deepest reaches of his being, is religious; he is determined by his relationship to God. Religion, to paraphrase the poet's expressive phrase, is not of life a thing apart, it is man's whole existence. Hutchison, indeed, comes to the same conclusion when he says, 'For religion is not one aspect or department of life beside the others, as modern secular thought likes to believe; it consists rather in the orientation of all human life to the absolute'. Tillich has captured the idea in a trenchant line, 'Religion is the substance of culture and culture the form of religion.'<br /><br />

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism">Westminster Shorter Catechism</a> maintains at the outset that man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. However other-worldly this may sound to some, Presbyterians have interpreted this biblically to mean that man is to serve God in his daily calling, which is the content of religion. This service cannot be expressed except through man's cultural activity, which gives expression to his religious faith. Now faith is the function of the heart, and out of the heart are the issues of life (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Prov.%204.23" target="_blank">Prov. 4:23</a>). This is the first principle of a biblically oriented psychology.<br /><br />

No man can escape this religious determination of his life, since God is the inescapable, ever-present <em>Fact</em> of man's existence. God may be loved or hated, adored or debased, but he cannot be ignored. The sense of God (<em>sensus deitatis</em>) is still the seed of religion (<em>semen religionis</em>). All of primitive religion is corroboration of the cry of the Psalmist, "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or wither shall I flee from thy presence?" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Ps.%20139.7" target="_blank">Ps. 139:7</a>).</blockquote>

And it is for this reason I steadfastly maintain that life <em>is</em> religion. There simply is no way around it.
