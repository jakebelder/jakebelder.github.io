<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted here at the end of the week. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of June together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>June 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.worldevangelicals.org/resources/source.htm?id=388" target="_blank"><strong>Calvin and World Mission</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.worldevangelicals.org" target="_blank">World Evangelical Alliance</a> has made available a collection of essays (211 pages worth!) on Calvin and world mission. It's available for free as a PDF. This promises to be a really interesting read.</li>
<li><a href="http://steidlville.com/books/1312-Paper-Passion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Steidl Paper Passion</strong></a> &ndash; Perfume that smells like a new book. How brilliant is this? Well, except for the price...&pound;70!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.leithart.com/2012/06/04/whos-got-the-gateway-drug/" target="_blank"><strong>Who's Got the Gateway Drug?</strong></a> and, <a href="http://www.barlowfarms.com/index/cm_id/1868314" target="_blank"><strong>Why Two Westminster Seminary California Graduates Have Left the Reformed Faith</strong></a> &ndash; Two very interesting pieces on the dangers of rigid confessionalism. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/136504244" target="_blank">I've responded in another post to this</a>, so I won't say any more here.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><a href="http://salternlite.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/tim-kellers-top-10-evangelism-tips/" target="_blank"><strong>Tim Keller's top 10 evangelism tips</strong></a> &ndash; Keller lays out a bit of a step-by-step approach to evangelism, which is quite interesting. He helpfully urges us to consider some things that we might not think about in the process of evangelism, particularly in terms of establishing relationships.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thesimplepastor.co.uk/connecting/" target="_blank"><strong>Connecting</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/simplepastor" target="_blank">Phil Whittall</a> relates a couple of neat stories on how social media has helped him connect face to face with others he might not have ever met. This is social media at its best.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/stamping-our-image-before-beale/06/" target="_blank">Stamping our Image (Before Beale)</a></strong> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood</a> shares <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/goudzwaard.htm" target="_blank">Bob Goudzwaard's</a> three basic biblical rules about mankind, a precursor to Beale's idea that <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/marchweb-only/idolatrygospelimitation.html" target="_blank">we become what we worship</a>.<a class="url" rel="external nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/JOty9c" target="_blank"></a></li>
<li><a href="http://jloudon.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/the-adamic-mission-of-the-church-2/" target="_blank"><strong>The Adamic Mission of the Church</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://jloudon.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Justin Borger</a>, a seminary colleague of mine, has a great post on why the cultural mandate still matters. This is a major oversight in much of evangelicalism and what is known as two-kingdom theology, and Justin helpfully demonstrates its biblical precedence. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/how-the-covenant-of-creation-shapes-our-calli-46794" target="_blank">I've addressed something similar recently too</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://redeemercitytocity.com/blog/view.jsp?Blog_param=436" target="_blank"><strong>Decentralized Preaching</strong></a> &ndash; Great post from one of <a href="http://redeemercitytocity.com/" target="_blank">Redeemer City to City's</a> directors, <a href="http://redeemercitytocity.com/profile/user_blogs.jsp?REDEEMERUSER_param=17" target="_blank">Allan Barth</a>, on the problems of the celebrity preacher phenomenon and the benefits of a rotation of preachers. </li>
<li><a href="http://simonjenkins.com/blog/entry/piety_builds_audiences/" target="_blank"><strong>Piety builds audiences</strong></a> &ndash; This is a really good post from <a href="https://twitter.com/simonjenks" target="_blank">Simon Jenkins</a> on the fake piety promoted by things like 'Jesus' Facebook pages. In addition to being kitsch and banal, he says that they deny the reality of true faith, which is often messy. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/anuncommongod.html" target="_blank"><strong>Common-Good Decisions: When Christians Bless the Cities of God</strong></a> &ndash; If you've not yet heard of the <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> project, here's a short introductory video highlighting what they're all about. <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city" target="_blank">It's worth following them</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/may/getting-to-the-crux-of-calvary.html?paging=off" target="_blank"><strong>Getting to the Crux of Calvary</strong></a> &ndash; This is an excellent article by Richard Mouw on the why substitutionary atonement highlights the truth of the cross more than any other atonement theory. He uses some powerful stories to make his point.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/technology/christian-leaders-are-powerhouses-on-twitter.html?_r=2" target="_blank"><strong>Christian Leaders Are Powerhouses on Twitter</strong></a> &ndash; An interesting look at why some Christian leaders have disproportionate influence on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.preachingtoday.com/skills/themes/sermonprep/manuscriptpreacher.html" target="_blank"><strong>Confessions of a Manuscript Preacher</strong></a> &ndash; I found this a very helpful article because I'm currently a manuscript preacher. Unfortunately, it seems to be stuck behind a pay-wall now.</li>
<li><a href="blog.acton.org/archives/33274-mindmaps-and-kuypers-wisdom-and-wonder.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mindmaps and Kuyper&rsquo;s Wisdom and Wonder</strong></a> &ndash; Steve Bishop has been drawing out mind maps of different books he's been reading recently, and some of his mind maps for Abraham Kuyper's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1937498905/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1937498905" target="_blank"><em>Wisdom and Wonder</em></a>, were recently published on the <a href="http://blog.acton.org/" target="_blank">Acton Institute blog</a>, along with some of his thoughts on why he uses this approach.</li>
<li><a href="http://redeemer.com/news_and_events/newsletter/?aid=363" target="_blank"><strong>Old Testament Law and the Charge of Inconsistency</strong></a> &ndash; Tim Keller challenges those who say Christians pick and choose which parts of the Bible they will believe, particularly with reference to the Old Testament laws. As you would expect, and rightly so, he points to Christ as the key to understanding it all.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3285/devils-in-the-details-the-return-of-the-gargoyle" target="_blank"><strong>Devils in the Details: The Return of the Gargoyle</strong></a> &ndash; I never knew the purpose of the gargoyles that adorn buildings like medieval cathedrals, so I found this was quite an interesting article.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2012061256749/National-news/the-power-of-faith-and-medicine.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ethnic minority turn to Jesus as more 'affordable' option</strong></a> &ndash; An interesting story about people coming to faith in Cambodia. Though the reason for moving to Christianity is a bit curious, what I find interesting is that they don't just give up on religion altogether. It's only Western people, after all, who try to supress the fact that humans are fundamentally religious.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/top-gear-live-world-record-double-loop-2012-6-15" target="_blank"><strong>Top Gear break a world record!</strong></a> &ndash; The <em>Top Gear</em> team did a live show in Durban, South Africa this past week, and pulled off a brilliant stunt inside the arena. Check it out!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/pastoral-suffering-in-union-with-christ/06/" target="_blank"><strong>Pastoral Suffering in Union with Christ</strong></a> &ndash; Matthew Mason looks at Colossians 1:24 and writes, "Pastors are called to embrace suffering for the sake of those they serve." This is helpful for those in ministry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.peter-ould.net/2012/06/18/travails-at-wycliffe-hall/" target="_blank"><strong>Travails at Wycliffe Hall</strong></a> &ndash; A very helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/PeterOuld" target="_blank">Peter Ould</a> analysing the events and the timeline surrounding Richard Turnbull's recent resignation as principle of <a href="http://www.wycliffe.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Wycliffe Hall, Oxford</a>. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2012/mayjun/preachersear.html?paging=off" target="_blank"><strong>Tuning the Preacher's Ear</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/hh/seminary_presidents/semm_pres_plantinga.htm" target="_blank">Cornelius Plantinga, Jr.</a>, former president of <a href="http://www.calvinseminary.edu" target="_blank">Calvin Theological Seminary</a>, writes on how good reading helps good preaching.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.faithandleadership.com/node/3014?page=full" target="_blank"><strong>Tradition for innovation</strong></a> &ndash; An excellent article by James K.A. Smith on why the church, if it wants to engage in restoring our broken world, needs to be grounded in a tradition. He writes, "If the church is going to send out 'restorers' who engage culture for  the common good, we need to recover and remember the rich imaginative      practices of historic Christian worship that carry the unique story of  the gospel."</li>
<li><a href="http://alissawilkinson.com/post/25431945111/thanks-to-wilfordlauren-for-making-this-easy" target="_blank"><strong>Getting Lewis right</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/alissamarie" target="_blank">Alissa Wilkinson</a> helpfully corrects those who think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis" target="_blank">C.S. Lewis</a> once said, "You don't have a soul. You are a Soul. You have a body." He didn't say it, and it's bad theology.</li>
<li><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/06/18/why-you-should-consider-cancelling-your-short-term-mission-trips/" target="_blank"><strong>Why You Should Consider Cancelling Your Short-Term Mission Trips</strong></a> &ndash; This is a very provocative and interesting piece. I have long been sceptical about short-term (shorter than a couple of months) mission trips, but this states the case much more clearly and persuasively than I could.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/foster-care-children.html?paging=off" target="_blank"><strong>Becoming a City Without Orphans</strong></a> &ndash; A great story about Christians in Fresno, California, working to make their city a city without orphans. Let's see churches work to make this happy in many more cities around the world! </li>

It means being 'wholeheartedly  willing and ready, from now on' to live for someone else, someone who  orchestrates things far beyond our field of vision."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.reformedcommunion.org/blogs/sam-wheatley/06/26/2012/liturgy" target="_blank">On Liturgy</a></strong> &ndash; My time as a worship director a few years ago gave me occasion to think a lot more about worship, and one of the things it cemented in my mind was the need for a well-ordered and structured liturgy. Every church has a liturgy already, but we need to carefully think about how it is ordered. <a href="http://www.joelgarver.com/" target="_blank">Joel Garver</a> has some helpful thoughts here on how liturgy helps us worship rightly and prepares us for life in the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.saet-online.org/grace-restores-nature/06/" target="_blank"><strong>Grace restores nature</strong></a> &ndash; Matthew Mason quotes <a href="https://calvinseminary.edu/about/profiles/john-bolt/" target="_blank">John Bolt</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck" target="_blank">Herman Bavinck's</a> discussion on what the gospel means for creation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=22634289&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=tor&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_22634289&amp;v=3" target="_blank"><strong>Must C: Crushed</strong></a> &ndash; I don't watch baseball, but someone linked to this replay of one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays" target="_blank">Toronto Blue Jays'</a> outfielders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Bautista" target="_blank">Jos&eacute; Bautista</a>, crushing a home run out &ndash; completely out &ndash; of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_park" target="_blank">Fenway Park</a>. It sailed into the car park beyond the wall, and in a moment of <em>Schadenfreude</em>, I couldn't help but smile as it hit and dented the roof of one of the ugliest vehicles ever made, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Nitro" target="_blank">Dodge Nitro</a>.</li>
