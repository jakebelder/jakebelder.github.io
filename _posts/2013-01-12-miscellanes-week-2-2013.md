<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>06-12 January 2013</strong>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/atheist-church-to-host-godless-sunday-gatherings-in-london-87652/" target="_blank">Atheist 'Church' to Host Godless Sunday Gatherings in London</a></strong> - The group of people who have set this up say they want to enjoy the good things about religion, like a sense of community, and this will give them the chance to hear from motivational speakers, and celebrate life together.</li>
<li><a href="http://simonjenkins.com/blog/entry/church_for_atheists/" target="_blank"><strong>Church for atheists</strong></a> - Hearing about the above, <a href="http://twitter.com/simonjenks" target="_blank">Simon Jenkins</a> thought it would be interesting to visit this 'church' and see what they're all about. Here's his take on their Sunday gathering.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eauk.org/current-affairs/politics/tackling-adoption-delays.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>Tackling adoption delays</strong></a> - Reports about the government moving to speed up the adoption process keep surfacing, which is very encouraging. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20973999" target="_blank">The number of children in care</a> here in the UK keeps rising, and more adopters are needed. The church needs to step up here, because this is a huge opportunity to put our faith into practice. The <a href="http://www.eauk.org/church/campaigns/adoption-and-fostering/" target="_blank">Evangelical Alliance is eager to help Christians do that</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://christiannews.net/2013/01/08/the-destructive-influence-of-pietism-in-american-society/" target="_blank"><strong>The Destructive Influence of Pietism in American Society</strong></a> - This is good: 'Pietism is why...80% of Christians do not know how to apply their Christianity to their everyday life. This is because Pietism fragments everything between the so-called &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; and the &ldquo;unspiritual&rdquo;...which results in the individual pietist conforming to every area of American life because he views Christianity as not being applicable to his everyday life and every area of life.' And this isn't just true of American Christianity.</li>
<li><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2013/01/what-will-you-read-in-2013/" target="_blank"><strong>What will you read in 2013?</strong></a>- Here's a great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland" target="_blank">Tim H&oslash;iland</a> on thinking carefully about what you read this year. He writes, 'If the books we read shape who we become, our reading choices have a lot to do with our very well-being.' He offers some questions to ask as we begin to cull a reading list for the year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mereorthodoxy.com/law-and-les-miserables-revisited/" target="_blank"><strong>Law and Les Miserables, Revisited</strong></a> - I've not read <em>Les Mis&eacute;rables</em>, nor have I seen the film, but <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbhood" target="_blank">Jason Hood's</a> analysis of the story is helpful. His reflections take a theological turn, noting particularly that grace and mercy is a basis for obeying the law, not ditching it. (On a side note, I've discovered he is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830827102/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0830827102&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank">having a book published later this year</a>, which I think is worth adding to your wishlist.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zachicks.com/blog/2013/1/10/can-kids-be-formed-by-worship-even-if-they-cant-understand-i.html" target="_blank"><strong>Can Kids be Formed by Worship Even if They Can&rsquo;t Understand&nbsp;It?</strong></a> -&nbsp; I'm glad this conversation keeps coming up, because it is an important one. This post is especially helpful, and asks, 'What if we had a learning theory broad enough to include "going through the motions" as a strong and valuable part of the formational process of learning?  In other words, what if our kids are shaped by the acts, structure, and flow of worship (including the sermon) even if they don&rsquo;t understand it all?'</li>
