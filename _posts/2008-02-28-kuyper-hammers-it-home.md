I know it's a long section of quotes, but it is worth your while. These are the concluding remarks to Abraham Kuyper's speech, "The Problem of Poverty," that he delivered at a Christian social congress in the Netherlands in 1891. Hear the words, imagine the force and conviction with which he would have delivered these – of course, I don't know what he sounded like, but I imagine an impassioned imploring of the crowds at this point.

And, naturally, only a Dutchman could use [the illustration of a dike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control_in_the_Netherlands) effectively.

<blockquote>
The goal that God has in view will never be reached by means of legal measures designed to improve social conditions. Rules alone will not cure our sick society, the medicine must also reach the heart of rich and poor. Sin is such a tremendous power that it mocks all your dikes and sluices, and in spite of our legal regulations, it will again and again flood the field of human life with the waters of its passion and selfishness.<br><br>

...Because we are conscious beings, almost everything depends on the standard of values which our consciousness constructs. If this present life is all there is, then I can understand that a man would desire to enjoy it before he dies, and would find the mystery of suffering wholly insoluble. Therefore, it is your calling, confessors of our Lord Jesus Christ, to place life eternal in the foreground for both rich and poor, and to do so with a gripping and soul-piercing earnestness. Only he who reckons with eternal life knows the real price of this earthly life. If external possession, if material good, if sensual pleasure is the whole of what is intended for man, then I can understand the materialist and do not see how I could properly reprimand the Epicurean. Therefore, it is your duty, children of the kingdom, to seize every occasion and means to impress on rich and poor that the peace of God is a much richer and holier treasure, and that the spiritual welfare of man is of much higher worth.<br><br>

...[A Christian], even of the lowest classes, knows how much the fear of our God can do for those who have only a meager portion of worldly goods...He will have thanked God for the bountiful share of a happy life and joyful heart that is theirs despite their limited means...For those of us more liberally endowed, all of our life, too, should be a single unbroken pronouncment of these holy principles. You who have received more may not wantonly fling these principles in the faces of the poor through your immoderate attachment to earthly goods---by giving the impression that enjoyment of luxury means more to you than anything else. Far worse, you should not grudgingly, with a heavy heart, distribute in the name of the Lord what you have received from him as your landlord. For then the less fortunate has no faith in your preaching, and he is right. Every man's inner sense of truth rebels against a theory of eternal happiness that serves only to keep Lazarus at a distance here on earth.<br><br>

There cannot be two different faiths – one for you and one for the poor. The question on which the whole social problem really pivots is whether you recognize the less fortunate, even in the poorest, not merely a creature, a person in wretched circumstances, but one of your own flesh and blood: for the sake of Christ, your brother. It is exactly this noble sentiment that, sad to say, has been weakened and dulled in such a provoking manner by the materialism of this century...This is holy ground, and he who would walk on it must first loosen the sandals of his egotism. The only sound permitted here is the stirring and eloquent voice of the merciful Samaritan whispering in our ears. There is suffering round about you, and those who suffer are your brothers, sharers of your nature, your own flesh and blood. You might have been in their place and they in your more pleasant position.<br><br>

The gospel speaks to you of a Redeemer who, although he was rich, became poor for your sake so he might make you rich. The gospel leads you to kneel down in worship before a child born to us, but born in a stable, laid down in a manger, and wrapped in swaddling clothes. It points you to God's Son, but one who became the Son of Man and went through the country, from wealthy Judea to the poorer, despised Galilee, addressing himself to those who were in need or oppressed by sorrow. Yes, it tells you that this singular Savior, before he left this earth, stooped before his disciples in the clothes of a slave, washed their feet one by one, and then stood and said, 'For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you' (John 13:15).<br><br>

...Divine compassion, sympathy, a suffering with us and for us – that was the mystery of Golgotha. You, too, must suffer with your suffering brothers. Only then will the holy music of consolation vibrate in your speech. Then, driven by this sympathy of compassion, you will naturally conform your action to your speech.<br><br>

...Our [society] must recognize Christ as its Savior. I close, therefore, with a prayer, a prayer that I know lives in the heart of each of you, that even if this rescue should be delayed, and even if the stream of unrighteousness must rise still higher, may it never be possible to say of the Christians of [any country on earth] that through our fault, through the lukewarmness of our Christian faith, whether in higher or lower classes, the rescue of our society was hindered and the blessing of the God of our fathers forfeited (72-79).

There is very little, if anything, to add to that except for an "Amen!" in affirmation of these words. This is, in reality, nothing new. Faith without deeds always has been and always will be dead. Grace is to evoke love from us, love for God and for neighbor. As Christ has served us, so we must do likewise that the world might know and confess that he is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
