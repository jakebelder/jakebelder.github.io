<p>This evening as I was again paging through my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Political-Visions-Illusions-Contemporary-Ideologies/dp/0830827269"><em>Political Visions and Illusions</em></a>, authored by my friend, <a href="http://byzantinecalvinist.blogspot.com">David Koyzis</a>, I happened upon this great paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
It has often been said that Christians are so heavenly minded as to be of no earthly good. This is a caricature of course, and one to which we should not too easily lend credence. At the same time, it must be conceded that many Christians in a variety of traditions often seem to behave in such a way as to vindicate this charge. Every time a believer says that, say, religion and politics do not mix or that we should concentrate on saving souls and leave the affairs of the world alone, she is implicitly denying the cosmic scope of Christ's redemption and thereby diminishing God's sovereignty. Every time a follower of Jesus forsakes a so-called secular occupation and claims an intention to go into 'full-time Christian service,' she is in effect relegating a huge portion of the total fabric of human life to something or someone other than the Savior of the world. For the biblically astute Christian, however, there are no 'sacred' or 'secular' occupations, only obedient and disobedient ones. The obedient farmer or carpenter is as much in full-time Christian service as the pastor or missionary (190).
</blockquote>
<p>David's implicit assertion here is that no part of life is left untouched by the lordship of Jesus Christ. He lays claim to everything, and as such, there can be no neutrality. This is why it can rightly be said that all of life is religion.</p>

For one of, if not <em>the</em>, best expressions of this idea be sure to read <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm">Albert Wolters'</a> excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creation-Regained-Biblical-Reformational-Worldview/dp/0802829694/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263606720&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview</em></a>. It will revolutionize the way you think.
