Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 269px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/holding%20a%20pint.jpg"></div>
Since I missed last week's instalment, here are the links from <strong>16-29 June 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/06/15/david-g-moore-i-guess-im-not-a-calvinist/">David G. Moore: “I guess I’m not a Calvinist.”</a></strong> – With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> recently debating the place of Calvinism in their denomination, David Moore takes some time to read a couple of books that help him realise Calvinism is something much bigger and more holistic than soteriology. This is really important to understand.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/fareforward/2013/06/cynicism-passion-and-the-onion/">Cynicism, Passion, and The Onion</a></strong> – This is a good post on how cynicism can blind us to reality, especially given its prevalence these days. The author helpfully notes, 'Cynicism prohibits us from seeing the world as the theater in which the divine drama of redemption is played out.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8932301/atheism-has-failed-only-religion-can-fight-the-barbarians/">Chief Rabbi: atheism has failed. Only religion can defeat the new barbarians</a></strong> – Here is a very good, incisive piece from Britain's chief rabbi, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sacks">Jonathan Sacks</a>, on how the West is suffering for its loss of faith. He suggests that unless we rediscover religion, our civilisation is in peril.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-drink-beer-for-big-ideas-coffee-to-get-513262326">Drink Beer for Big Ideas, Coffee to Get Them Done</a></strong> – I don't know about you, but this sounds like a 'win-win' situation to me.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/2013/06/why-read/">The end of reading</a></strong> – A great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland">Tim Høiland</a> on the importance reading, and more specifically, the importance of <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> you read. He remarks, 'The discipline of reading widely and well is a crucial part of loving God with our minds and loving our neighbors as ourselves.' </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://trinityhouseinstitute.com/reorienting-our-sex-talk/">Reorienting our Sex Talk</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewwmason">Matthew Mason</a> contributes some very thought-provoking observations to the current discussions on sexuality, noting particularly that the Bible does not look at humans from the perspective of sexual orientation. He concludes, 'God does not address us as sexually defined subjects. And therefore neither should we.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.washingtoninst.org/5209/fidelity-to-abide-to-belong/">Fidelity: To abide, to belong</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/TWI_vocation">The Washington Institute</a> ran this excellent piece exploring the rich meaning of the word 'fidelity'. It really just opens up the fullness of what it means to have committed relationships based on God's created design.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/how-reading-makes-us-more-human/277079/?utm_content=buffercad75&utm_source=buffer">How Reading Makes Us More Human</a></strong> – This is quite an interesting article. The author notes, 'The <em>way</em> we read can be even more important than <em>what</em> we read. In fact, reading good literature won't make a reader a better person any more than sitting in a church, synagogue or mosque will. But reading good books <em>well</em> just might.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/july-august/sex-without-bodies.html?paging=off&utm_source=buffer&utm_campaign=Buffer&utm_content=buffer6c965&utm_medium=twitter#bmb=1">Sex Without Bodies</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc">Andy Crouch</a> contributed this brilliant piece to the ongoing discussion on sexuality by observing that so much of the way our culture understands sexuality is essentially gnostic. He goes on to make some important remarks about how the church can respond to this. It's worth noting that this article sparked off a longer conversation – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> responded <a href="http://spiritualfriendship.org/2013/06/27/how-do-bodies-matter/">with his own post</a>, and Crouch again <a href="http://spiritualfriendship.org/2013/06/27/how-do-bodies-matter/#comment-1412">responded to him</a>. The contributions are all worth reading.</li>
