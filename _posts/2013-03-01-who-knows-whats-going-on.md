This three-minute video is amusing, but also raises some very interesting questions. We often prize the idea of religious freedom, but a plethora of  religious choice raises questions of certainty for many people. Who  really knows what's going on? <a href="http://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a>, who <a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/q-marks-the-spot-treasure-map-54-march-2013/" target="_blank">posted this on his blog</a> the other day, wonders where we can begin to respond to something like this. Any thoughts?
