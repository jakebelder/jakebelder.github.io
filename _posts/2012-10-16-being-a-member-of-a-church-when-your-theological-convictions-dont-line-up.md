<p>Few churches, I suspect, would be composed of a group of believers entirely homogeneous in their beliefs and convictions. To be sure, most churches don't require this &ndash; and I would add that we ought to be extremely wary of those who do &ndash; but instead require a commitment to the basic tenets of orthodox Christianity and a commitment to the mission and vision of the church. Some go farther and require subscription to a confessional document outlining in more detail the beliefs and convictions of the church.</p>

<p>But the reality in our increasingly un-churched Western culture is that there are many Christians who belong to churches that do not fully line up with their convictions. This is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. Here in England, for example, you find that quite often, due to the lack of orthodox, gospel-centred churches. People who consider themselves Anglicans find themselves attending a free church in another town because that is the only evangelical church in the area, and vice versa. I have been thinking about this recently, and it raises some questions worth discussing, particularly regarding <em>how</em> one is good member of a church in a situation like this. That is, how does a believer actively practice submission to the leadership of the church when their convictions don't fully line up with the teaching of the church?</p>
<p>Let's take that all-too-frequently hotly contested issue of baptism as an example. Let's say that you come from a tradition that baptises believers on their profession of faith, but you find yourself living in a place where there are no churches from your tradition. Down the road, however, is a solid evangelical church that faithfully teaches and preaches the Bible and is doing some great work as ambassadors of Christ and his Kingdom. But they practice infant baptism.</p>
<p>Most Christians I know would not have a problem joining such a church, and participating fully in its life. But there is obviously a significant and major practice the church engages in that you don't agree with. What do you do? How do act as a good member of the church in that situation? If the official teaching of the church is that the baptism of infants is a biblical practice, are you obligated to remain quiet about your position? Should you publicise your opposition to the practice?</p>

This opens up a variety of other topics, such as confessionalism, ecclesiology, the way our theological convictions are formed, and how Christians relate to one another. I have some thoughts on all of this, but I want to open the conversation first, as I would be very interested to hear what others think. Please comment below...
