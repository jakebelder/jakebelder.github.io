<p>Reading over at <a href="http://www.theresurgence.com/">The Resurgence</a> yesterday, they had <a href="http://theresurgence.com/Six_Ways_to_Engage_Culture">a post about how to engage (for lack of better term) culture as a Christian</a>. This was helpful as I continue to talk about <a href="http://jakebelder.com/wolters-on-the-role-of-worldview">the idea of worldview</a> and how to think biblically, making Scripture <a href="http://jakebelder.com/wisdom-that-sees-life-as-a-whole">the source of our wisdom</a> for living in this world. So when I came across this, I could resonate well with it.</p>
<p>Talking about how to address cultural issues from a biblical and theological standpoint since the Bible does not speak directly to many of things we need to deal with as Christians in our society, <a href="http://theresurgence.com/user/664">Jonathan Dodson</a> says this:</p>

<blockquote>
The problem...is that we often start with cultural <em>assumptions</em> about what is right, beautiful, and good and go to the Bible to prove them. Instead, we need to bring cultural <em>questions</em> about what is true, good, and beautiful to the Bible, reflect on them theologically and then prayerfully, and carefully form our opinions. Don't begin with cultural convictions and end with biblical proof-texts; end with cultural wisdom by beginning with biblical-theological reflection. Start with the biblical text and reflect theologically on cultural issues. Move from Text to Theology to Culture, not the other way around.
</blockquote>

Often, we are entirely unaware of the influence of the values and ideas of our culture on our own heart and mind. This has a significant bearing on how we look at, think about, and speak to culture. In order to begin to think about how we are to relate to culture, it is essential that we first make a conscious effort to ensure that we are rooted in the wisdom found in Scripture and operate from a worldview that is shaped by that wisdom.
