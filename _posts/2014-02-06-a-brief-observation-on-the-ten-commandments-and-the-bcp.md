Near the beginning of [The Order for the Administration of the Lord's Supper (or Holy Communion)](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-lord%27s-supper-or-holy-communion.aspx) in the Book of Common Prayer, the [Ten Commandments](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20.1-17&version=NIV) are read. After each commandment is read by the priest, the congregation responds with this refrain:

<blockquote>
Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.
</blockquote>

I hadn't really paid close attention to this before, but it struck me today whilst listening to [Thomas Tallis' arrangement of the Commandments](http://open.spotify.com/track/0I30kmm797vYIsj1wbH5rq) that two important things are reinforced by this practice. The first is the recognition that we break each commandment all the time. And that necessitates that each time we come together, we ask the Lord to have mercy upon us for these specific sins. There is also an implicit acknowledgement here that each commandment has broad applications that go beyond the literal command. The second is that the Commandments remain binding on us, hence the prayer that the Lord incline our hearts to keep each law.

After the tenth commandment is read, a final refrain is rehearsed, asking again both for forgiveness and for God to shape our hearts to be obedient to his commandments:

<blockquote>
Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee.
</blockquote>
