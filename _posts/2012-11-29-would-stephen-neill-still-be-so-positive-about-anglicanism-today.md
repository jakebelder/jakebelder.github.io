<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Neill" target="_blank">Stephen Neill</a>, in his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001KWOT1S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B001KWOT1S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank">history of Anglicanism</a>, notes that it was during the period of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_settlement" target="_blank">Elizabethan Settlement</a> that Anglicanism really began to form its unique character. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_cranmer" target="_blank">Thomas Cranmer</a> had done significant work already to reform the English church, influenced quite extensively by a number of the Continental reformers, although he had wished to move forward more cautiously than many of them had in their respective contexts. Others in England, who came to be known as the Puritans and who had quite a significant influence on the church, were more bold and assertive than Cranmer, and longed for a Genevan-style Reformation. Another extreme was to be found under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England" target="_blank">Mary</a>, where Roman Catholicism attempted to reassert its heavy-handed rule once more.</p>

<p>Elizabeth's long and relatively stable reign enabled the Church of England to begin to take on a more distinctive shape. Largely owing to the tumultuous history that preceded the Elizabethan era, the Anglican church would become a church that sought to avoid extremes on either end of the spectrum. Neill writes,</p>
<blockquote>
By 1593, the Church of England had shown plainly that it would not walk in the ways of either Geneva or Rome. This is the origin of the famous <em>Via Media</em>, the middle way, of the Church of England. But a 'middle way' which means 'neither this nor that' seems a rather negative road. And a middle way which is no more than a perpetual compromise, an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable, is not like to inspire anyone to heroism or to sanctity. Such is the caricature of the Anglican position which is the current coin of controversialists, and nothing could be further from the truth. Anglicanism is a very positive form of Christian belief; it affirms that it teaches the whole of Catholic faith, free from the distortions, the exaggerations, the over-definitions both of the Protestant left wing and of the right wing of Tridentine Catholicism. Its challenge can be summed up in the phrases, 'Show us anything clearly set forth in Holy Scripture that we do not teach, and we will teach it; show us anything in our teaching and practice that is plainly contrary to Holy Scripture, and we will abandon it.'
</blockquote>
<p class="ftxt">The idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_media" target="_blank"><em>Via Media</em></a> is an intriguing one, not least because its very definition is highly contentious. However, Neill seems to use it in the sense of there being a well-defined confessional foundation that avoids being too prescriptive in secondary matters, and I think that is the best way to understand it. Anglicanism has always been a confessional tradition (and a Reformed one, at that), as stated in Canon A5 of the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/churchlawlegis/canons.aspx" target="_blank">Church of England's Canon Law</a>, which asserts, 'The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, <em>The Book of Common Prayer</em>, and the Ordinal.' But at the same time, fear of the extremism the English church had historically known meant it purposefully avoided being overly prescriptive in what its members were expected to subscribe to.</p>
<p class="ftxt">That is the point Neill is getting at above. However, he wrote those words in 1958, and one wonders if he would continue to be so positive today. The biggest problem is that the Church of England is no longer defined by its confessional and doctrinal basis, but is defined much more by that caricature that Neill abhors &ndash; perpetual compromise and an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable. And when that is not the case, alignment with the 'middle way' increasingly means conformity to the liberal establishment. To be sure, Anglicanism does require its members to have, to some degree, conciliatory spirits, but in our day that has given way to unprincipled compromise for the sake of visible unity. This has resulted in a denomination that is marked by growing polarisation, as groups on either side of the centre are marginalised. You can observe this polarisation in big ways, such as the defection of a number of people to the Roman Catholic Church in the past couple of years, and in small ways, such as the resurgence of interest in the Puritans amongst conservative evangelicals.</p>

As it is right now, the Church of England will only continue to polarise until it breaks apart, something made very clear by <a href="http://jakebelder.com/some-scattered-thoughts-about-conservative-ev" target="_blank">the recent fallout over the issue of women bishops</a>. The only way to prevent this is for the Church of England to undergo a thorough process of reform, beginning with the recovery of its Scriptural and theological foundation. It is about getting back to what the Church of England was designed to be &ndash; a middle way in which churches would be united on a shared doctrinal basis, with some liberty in expression and practice, yet always committed to ongoing reformation in accordance with Scripture. Authentic, orthodox Anglicanism will not stand on anything less.
