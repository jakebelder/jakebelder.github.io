<p>French historian, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Duby">Georges Duby</a>, proposed in his 1976 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Age-Cathedrals-Art-Society-980-1420/dp/0226167704/sr=8-1/qid=1165445332/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-6982046-6272628?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Age of the Cathedrals</span></a>, that the creation of the Gothic cathedrals in Europe were attempts by the Church to repress heresy.  I came across this theory just the other night.  It is interesting to note, because the time when the majority of the cathedrals were being built was the time that the Catholic Church began a widespread attempt to purge the Church of heresy.  On a side note, reading of some of the atrocities that were committed at the orders of the Pope, it is no wonder the Catholic Church gets such a bad rap in so much of history.</p>

<p>It began as an attempt to revive Christianity amongst the common people of medieval Europe, and to do so by eliminating heretical ideas from the Church.  The authority given to bishops was greatly increased, and they became responsible for ensuring that people were given proper theological instruction, and that those who held to heresies were properly rebuked (or eradicated).  The cathedral was built in the center of the diocese, intended to be the "nexus of the bishops moral authority and the momument to his role.  Cathedrals were the centers from which bishops taught the correct and true message of the Church" (Robert A. Scott, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gothic-Enterprise-Understanding-Medieval-Cathedral/dp/0520231775/sr=1-2/qid=1165445765/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6982046-6272628?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Gothic Enterprise</span></a>, 74).  It's an interesting connection.</p>
