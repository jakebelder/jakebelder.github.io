<p>The <a href="http://www.eauk.org/" target="_blank">Evangelical Alliance</a> have been talking about fostering and adoption a lot over the past year, and how the church can rise up to meet the needs of children who are in care across the UK. <a href="http://www.krishk.com" target="_blank">Krish Kandiah</a> (who introduces and closes the short video below) has been leading this initiative, and now they are getting read to launch '<a href="http://www.eauk.org/church/campaigns/adoption-and-fostering/home-for-good.cfm" target="_blank">Home for good</a>' in March, a campaign designed 'to encourage and equip churches to be intentional about the recruitment and support of foster carers and adopters.'</p>
<p>Check out the video below, and if you're interested in finding out more, be sure to connect with <a href="http://www.careforthefamily.org.uk/adopt/" target="_blank">Care for the Family</a>. Let's seize on to this huge opportunity, because we can make a big difference. If you want to be a missional church, here's a place to start. Get people in your church fostering and adopting children.</p>
