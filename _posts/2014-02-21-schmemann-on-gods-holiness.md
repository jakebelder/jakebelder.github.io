One of the things I've always appreciated about the Eastern Orthodox tradition is its emphasis on the holiness and 'otherness' of God. [Alexander Schmemann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Schmemann), in his book, *[For the Life of the World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0913836087/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0913836087&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, makes this observation:

<blockquote>
'Holy' is the real name of God, of the God 'not of scholars and philosophers,' but of the living God of faith. The knowledge <em>about</em> God results in definitions and distinctions. The knowledge <em>of</em> God leads to this one, incomprehensible, yet obvious and inescapable word: holy. And in this word we express both that God's the Absolutely Other, the One <em>about</em> whom we know nothing, and that He is the end of all our hunger, all our desires, the inaccessible One who mobilises our wills, the mysterious treasure that attracts us, and there is really nothing to know but Him. 'Holy' is the word, the song, the 'reaction' of the Church as it enters into heaven, as it stands before the heavenly glory of God (32).
</blockquote>

Although I would not say with Schmemann or the Eastern Orthodox tradition that we know *nothing* about God – Christianity, after all, is based on his self-revelation – I sometimes think we Protestants could do to recapture this sense of the 'otherness' of God. Yes, God is the loving Father who guides us with his right hand (Psalm 139:10), but he's also the holy Lord before whom we are to tremble as we worship him in the splendour of his holiness (Psalm 96:9).
