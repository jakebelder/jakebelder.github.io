The [Church of England](http://www.churchofengland.org) released [a bunch of statistics this morning](http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/05/church-annual-statistics-for-2011.aspx) on church attendance in 2011. As a mainline denomination, the Church of England is quite liberal, and as you would expect, this means that numbers have been falling steadily for some time now. However, the data released this morning showed that 2011 did not see the same steady decline of previous years. It was interesting to observe the response to the data for 2011, which was largely greeted with excitement, heralding this as a turning point.

That kind of reaction is a bit presumptuous, of course. As Peter Ould helpfully stated [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/PeterOuld/status/331710817051484160) earlier this morning, ‘Dear CofE friends. One year's rise after 10 years decline doth not a change in trend make.’ In reality, the numbers do not really tell us that much, and it would be a mistake to try and read anything too significant into them. Most notably, they don't tell us anything about the faith of the individuals who attend each week, since church attendance is not necessarily an indication of a living and active faith, nor does it tell us anything about the faithfulness of each local church.

There is one thing that the numbers do tell us, however: there is a *lot* of work to be done. I do not know the total population of all the areas covered by the Church of England, but if we take England’s population alone, which was 53,012,456 in the 2011 census, and the average weekly attendance of 1,091,484, that means that only 2.05% of the population attends an Anglican church each week (in reality the percentage will be less because the Church of England operates outside of England as well, such as in the Diocese of Europe). Now, the Church of England is not the only denomination in England, of course, so there is more than just 2.05% of the population in a church each Sunday. But the numbers won’t be anything significantly greater; I’d be surprised if the total amounted to more than 5%.

In the end, it is this statistic that deserves the most attention. On any given Sunday, the vast majority of the population is not in a church, not hearing the gospel proclaimed, not hearing the call to confess Christ as Lord and Saviour. Don't focus on the slowing decline; focus on the massive need that remains in every single parish around the country.
