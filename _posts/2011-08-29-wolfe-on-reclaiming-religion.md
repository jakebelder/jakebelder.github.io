<p><a href="http://www.gregorywolfe.com/">Gregory Wolfe</a>, in the most recent edition of <em><a href="http://www.awpwriter.org/magazine/">The Writer's Chronicle</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
We want to reclaim both the word [religion] and the thing the word signifies. Yes, it is a way of pushing back at what I would consider an overly simplistic, overly smug argument that is made these days by people who, for one reason or another, are alienated from the idea of people of faith coming together. I am not arguing for the immaculate nature of institutional faith, but I do believe that there is a tendency in our culture toward solipsism, toward an individualism so radical that it becomes essentially meaningless for the public square. If everyone is living privately inside their own heads, then the religious phenomenon has no public center of gravity and there&rsquo;s no communicable experience. I don&rsquo;t think that all institutional religion is the work of the devil. Frankly, it remains durable. Public living traditions of faith continue to have a huge impact, for better or worse, on our world. And to somehow hold yourself aloof from all that seems to me to be a little coy, honestly.
