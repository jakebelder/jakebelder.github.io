At Grace West Church on Sunday, Dr. Stephen Beck had a sermon entitled, &ldquo;Decisions That Are Guided by the Holy Spirit&rdquo;.  It was part two of a series he&rsquo;s doing on the Holy Spirit, working through the first couple of chapters of Acts.  It was a fantastic sermon, and really touched me, being extremely relevant to some of the things I&rsquo;m dealing with right now.  So I wanted to share a bit of a summary here.

One of the biggest questions Christians find themselves asking is how we can determine the will of God for our lives when there are major decisions in front of us.  We often ask ourselves how we know we are not seeking our own will instead of God&rsquo;s, or trying to force our will on Him.  Dr. Beck said there is an overarching idea that we can place over top of all of this.  That is this: <strong><em>Focus on your daily communion with God, and He will focus on the sovereign ordering of His plan for your life.</em></strong>

He then illustrated several points as to how we go about making decisions with this in mind.

First, we must live our lives within the sphere of God&rsquo;s guidance.  Using Acts 1:14 to highlight his point, Dr. Beck said that one of the ways we can do this is to be like the apostles and be persistent in prayer.  We have to ask ourselves if we are living within the arena where God gives guidance to life and subsequently if our prayer lives reflect that, or if they are just haphazard, only becoming intense in crisis situations.  He further illustrated that our prayer life is like a marriage relationship.  Through it we get to know the other well, and it always needs constant attention to be healthy.

Secondly, we must order our lives according to God&rsquo;s word.  The Holy Spirit speaks through the Scriptures, it inspires the Word, illumines it for us, and applies it to our hearts.  We have to ask ourselves what the Spirit is saying to us through the Bible.  Sometimes we&rsquo;ll find guidance in a direct command, other times a historical account where we can learn from the character(s), and other times it will be a principle.  If we order our lives according to God&rsquo;s Word, He will order our steps.

Thirdly, we must just use our common sense.

Fourth, we have to pray about the particular matter in front of us.  We need to call God into the situation, and lay it all at His feet.  As it says in 1 Peter, cast all your cares on Him.  Prayer is the means of gaining God&rsquo;s heart.

Fifth, we need to discern through the Spirit&rsquo;s ways and movements in our lives.  We need to first discern if the matter is ethical, prudent, and beneficial.  Then we need to discern what our desires are.  The Spirit implants the desires of God in our life so that we desire what God desires&mdash;what is Biblical.  We shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate our desires.  At the same time, we must be aware of our motives in moving towards a decision, and that they are God-glorifying.  We must also discern our spiritual gifts.  Where can we be put to work so that we produce growth?  Finally, we must discern through the advice of those around us who are wise.  God places those people in our lives so we can gain true wisdom from them, those who are mature in their faith.

Sixth and finally, we must make a decision.

The sovereignty of God does not make us prisoners, but rather it makes us free.  Our decisions and desires are conformed to the will of God.  We can rest assured that even if we make a decision that is not the best, God allowed us to make that decision so as to learn from it.  We will NEVER make a decision that is contrary to God&rsquo;s will and plan for our lives.  We rest securely in the hands of a God who will never let us go, and will always love us immeasurably more than we can imagine.

Focus on your daily communion with God, and He will focus on the sovereign ordering of His plan for your life.
