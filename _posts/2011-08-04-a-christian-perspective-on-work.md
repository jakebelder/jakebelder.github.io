<p>When I read James Davison Hunter's book, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/pFZoW2">To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World</a></em>, last year, one of the things he talked about repeatedly was the need for the church to work out a theology of vocation. In the video below, Mark Greene, of the <a href="http://www.licc.org.uk/">London Institute for Contemporary Christianity</a>, talks about how believers should understand their Monday-Saturday work as part of the call of God's people to make known the Kingdom of God. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/getting-work-right">There are a lot of misconceptions about work among Christians</a> &ndash; that we work just to pay the bills, that working as a pastor or missionary is a higher calling, that being a Christian in the workplace means just evangelising your co-workers &ndash; but these do not square with the fact that humanity was designed to work.</p>
<p>(FYI: the sound quality on the video is not great and Greene's voice is often washed out by the music, so listen carefully.)</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, Hunter argues that it is the church that needs to work out a theology of vocation. This is about the formation of disciples. These are the sorts of <a href="http://jakebelder.com/doing-theology-locally">big questions we need to be addressing in our local contexts</a>.</p>

The bottom line is that believers need to understand that&nbsp;<a href="http://jakebelder.com/what-you-do-matters"><em>what they do matters</em></a>.
