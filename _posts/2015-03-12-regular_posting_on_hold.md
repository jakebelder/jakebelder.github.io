Despite having a growing list of thoughts and ideas I have been meaning to turn into posts, time in which to do so has been eluding me as of late. What's more, over the next couple of months, I have a lot of different things going on;Â there are some fairly substantial projects to I need to complete, and I will also be doing some travelling. As a result, I am putting posting here on hold, probably until May. At that point, I expect things to settle down a little bit and can hopefully begin posting more regularly again.

As always, thanks for reading, and if you would like to connect with me in the interim, I can still be found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder).
