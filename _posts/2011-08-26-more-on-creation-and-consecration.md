Following [yesterday's post](http://jakebelder.com/creation-waits-for-consecration), I have been thinking more about VanGemeren's idea of creation and consecration as he lays it out in his book, *[The Progress of Redemption](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0801020816/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0801020816)*. Over on Facebook, [Jon Swales](http://twitter.com/jonswales77) helpfully pointed out that Eden, as a temple, was consecrated. It does seem to follow that, since the presence of God was there in a very real way, Eden was a holy place.

What's more, VanGemeren seems to argue that since God intended creation to be something more than it was at the beginning, consecration would come when it reached that fulfilment. There is a problem here, however, because he argues at the same time that the Sabbath was consecrated. Yet, the Sabbath instituted at creation is also just a foretaste of the eschatological eternal Sabbath (Hebrews 4:9).

Do any of you have further thoughts about this?
