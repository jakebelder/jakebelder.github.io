Included in the pile of books I've read recently was [Hans Boersma's](http://www.regent-college.edu/faculty/full-time/hans-boersma) book, *[Heavenly Participation: The Weaving of a Sacramental Tapestry](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802865429/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0802865429&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, which is essentially a plea for a return to a sacramental view of reality that re-unites the natural and supernatural, or heaven and earth, something he argues has been separated in much of modern thinking. For a solution, Boersma looks especially to the mid-20th century *[nouvelle théologie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_Th%C3%A9ologie)* movement, associated with theologians like [Yves Congar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Congar), [Henri de Lubac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_De_Lubac), and [Jean Daniélou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dani%C3%A9lou), all of whom sought to recapture this sacramental view of reality that had characterised what is known as the Great Tradition, the name Boersma uses to refer to the broad consensus of theology and practice amongst the church fathers and medieval theologians.

Because it is the context he is writing from and into, Boersma's argument is largely directed towards evangelicals. Much of the book is an attempt to demonstrate how evangelical sacramentology would benefit from looking to and being informed by the *nouvelle théologie* movement. Given his perspective and influence, it is unsurprising that, to make his case, he directly critiques evangelical sacramentology at various points throughout the book. With regards to the Eucharist in particular, he makes the following comment, which essentially sums up what he perceives to be the main weakness in the general evangelical understanding of this sacrament:

<blockquote>
The overall attitude of evangelicals continues to regard the Eucharist…as belonging to the well-being (<em>bene esse</em>) rather than the very being (<em>esse</em>) of the Christian life… If our connection with God is primarily an external or nominal one, rather than one that is real or participatory, there is little room for what traditional theology used to call sacraments or means of grace. According to such an understanding, one may still celebrate communion because it is an 'ordinance' of God that regulates our common life together; but the Eucharist will hardly be regarded as a sacrament that participates in the life of Christ and thus as something that mediates to us the life of the triune God (105).
</blockquote>

Though I don't find Boersma's overall argument entirely persuasive, I'm sympathetic to the point he makes here. I was talking with someone recently about how evangelicals generally value the practice of church discipline, which usually involves, amongst other things, cutting off an unrepentant sinner from participating in Holy Communion. We wondered aloud whether, given the Zwinglian tendencies in evangelical sacramentology, this action really accomplished anything. It might be unpleasant to be kept from participating in an act of remembrance that everyone around you is taking part it, but surely discipline becomes a much bigger deal if you are cut off from something that actually contributes in a very real way to your growth in grace and maturity, and to the deepening of your union with Christ.

I suppose this is one of the enduring questions with regards to the sacraments – what does it really mean for them to be a means of grace? What do they actually *do*? We are perfectly happy to talk about Scripture as a means of grace that effects real transformation in the lives of people, so why would we not expect the sacraments as means of grace to do something as well? I am just thinking out loud here, but I believe these are questions that more evangelicals need to face head-on.
