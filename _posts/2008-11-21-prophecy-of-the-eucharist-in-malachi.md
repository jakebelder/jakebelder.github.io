<p>In the discussion on the ecclesiology of the early church in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._N._D._Kelly">J.N.D. Kelly's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Early-Christian-Doctrines-J-Kelly/dp/0826452523/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1221615416&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Early Christian Doctrines</span></a>, the following observation is made:</p>

<blockquote>
The Eucharist was regarded as the distinctively Christian sacrifice from the closing decade of the first century, if not earlier. Malachi's prediction (Mal. 1:10ff.) that the Lord would reject the Jewish sacrifices and instead would have a 'pure offering' made to Him by the Gentiles in every place was early seized upon by Christians as a prophecy of the Eucharist (196).
</blockquote>

<p>I found this quite interesting for two reasons: first, I have never heard this line of thought before, and was surprised to see that many of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers">Church Fathers</a> thought this way. Kelly here references the discussions of the Eucharist in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didache">Didache</a></span> and in the writings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_of_alexandria">Clement</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Antioch">Ignatius</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus_of_Lyons">Irenaeus</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr">Justin</a> as all understanding the Eucharist in a sacrificial sense. Justin makes reference to the prophecy in Malachi several times in his writings, directly applying it to the Eucharist.</p>

Second, my library does not contain a lot of commentaries, but in the two older ones I have the discussion of this passage in Malachi says absolutely nothing about the sacrament. I was not surprised, and do not consider this passage to apply to the Eucharist. But I am interested to know if there are any commentaries out there that make this point or allude to it. What do your commentaries say? Pull them off the shelf and let me know.
