<p>Some of my more recent posts have made mention of <a href="http://www.biblicaltheology.ca/blueauthors.htm#mg">Michael Goheen</a>, who I was privileged to study under during college. Some time ago, <a href="http://setsnservice.wordpress.com/">Anthony Stiff</a> posted the link to the audio of a <a href="http://churchbootcamp.com/">conference in San Diego</a> that Goheen spoke at, which I have also linked to recently. Although a lot of the material I had heard before in the classes I took with him, I felt like it got me more excited than it had the first time I heard it. Here are the links to the talks. I encourage you to download them and listen to them for yourself. It will not be wasted time.</p>
<p>In the courses I took with him, I read his dissertation on the missionary ecclesiology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesslie_Newbigin">J.E. Lesslie Newbigin</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bosch">David Bosch's</a> monumental work, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Mission-Paradigm-Theology-Missiology/dp/0883447193/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216588363&amp;sr=8-1">Transforming Mission</a></em>. Both were very influential in shaping my thinking about the nature of the Church. Coming into Goheen's classes, I was not aware of any preconceived ideas I had about the Church, but what he taught as well as the things I read in the readings he assigned to us, shattered those ideas enough to realize that even if I wasn't aware of it, I actually did have preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>It would be a challenge to sum up the message he tried to convey in those classes and in the more recent conference, but the essence of it is this: If the gospel is about the restoration and renewal of the whole of human life and all of creation, then the Church's mission is as wide as creation. The calling of the Church is to make known the good news, as Jesus did. When Jesus was on earth he announced the coming of the Kingdom repeatedly with his words and deeds. He said that if we heard his words and saw his deeds, we would see the Kingdom. Then he commissioned his disciples: "As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you." The commission was to proclaim the Lordship of Christ wherever they went, to declare that this is his world and it all belongs to him. So the mission of the Church then is to embody in its life and announce with words that the whole of the world belongs to Christ.</p>
<p>Although earlier conceptions of mission were rooted in the idea of going out and doing something, we need to steer away from these. Because the fact is that the mission of the Church is what defines us, it is our identity. When Christ commissioned the Church he did not give it a task, but was establishing an identity. Newbigin says,</p>

<blockquote>
The Church cannot be defined <span style="font-style: italic;">simply</span> as that which is constituted by the event of the preaching of the Gospel and the administering of the sacraments. It belongs to its true nature that it is a continuing historical society, that society which was constituted and sent forth once for all by Jesus Christ (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/household-God-Lectures-nature-church/dp/B0007DPR5S/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217533785&amp;sr=8-5">The Household of God</a></em>, 60).
</blockquote>

This is where our ecclesiology must begin.
