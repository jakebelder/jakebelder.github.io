<p>Since I have a few posts in the pipeline about the city, building on <a href="http://jakebelder.com/religion-and-the-city">yesterday's post</a>, I found this to be quite interesting. <a href="http://www.culture-making.com/about/andy_crouch/">Andy Crouch</a> talks about a shift in how we identify ourselves&mdash;previous generations would define themselves by their <em>work</em>, but today's generation finds the identity of <em>place</em> much more important. I've observed myself that people will often ask where you are from before they ask what you do, although this may have to do with the fact that I live in a very transient place, one which very few people call 'home' in the sense of being born and raised here.</p>
