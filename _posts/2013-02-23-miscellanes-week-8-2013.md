<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<p>Here are the links from <strong>17-23 February 2013</strong>.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.anthonysmith.me.uk/2013/02/18/freedom-from-nature/" target="_blank"><strong>Freedom from nature</strong></a> - Here is a good post from <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith" target="_blank">Anthony Smith</a> on the false understanding of freedom that so many in our culture operate with, and which also asserts itself in different ways in Christianity.</li>
<li><a href="http://forsclavigera.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/monday-morning-musing-god-doesnt-need.html" target="_blank"><strong>God Doesn't Need our Help</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith" target="_blank">James K.A. Smith</a> observes that since faith is a gift of God, we don't need to dumb it down to make it palatable to the world around us. He writes, "If God is going to grant the gift of belief, it seems that God would  able to grant and empower a faith that can also believe the scandalous.  In other words, God doesn't need our help."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2013/02/18/church-was-great-lets-not-talk-about-it/" target="_blank">Church Was Great! Let&rsquo;s Not Talk About It</a></strong> - So many conversations after church turn to subjects which have nothing to do with the hour just spent before the throne of God. The author of this helpful post asks, why not? Let's take the opportunity to encourage and build each other up in faith. This is a good challenge for all of us.</li>
<li><a href="http://redeemercitytocity.com/blog/view.jsp?Blog_param=464&amp;buffer_share=07d8a&amp;utm_source=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Starting from Scratch in Montreal</strong></a> - It is always deeply encouraging to hear stories of churches and church planters making headway in cities where the church is all but nonexistent, and this story from a church planter in Montr&eacute;al is no different.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/leithart/2013/02/18/baptismal-efficacy-2/" target="_blank"><strong>Baptismal efficacy</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/PLeithart" target="_blank">Peter Leithart</a> writes that because the Reformers rejected the idea of penance, baptism became more powerful and more lasting. "The Reformers are often charged with diminishing the potency of baptism," he writes. "The opposite is the case." I would be interested in seeing this fleshed out further, but there is some good food for thought here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2012-12/pastor-not-friend" target="_blank"><strong>Pastor, not friend</strong></a> - This post suggests that pastors and a parishioners tend to have a relationship which doesn't really lend itself to forming deep friendships. From my own (albeit limited) experience, I am inclined to agree, although I received some interesting feedback on Twitter from folks who disagreed. This may be worth exploring further.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.9marks.org/blog/7-things-pastors-should-teach-those-marketplace" target="_blank"><strong>7 Things Pastors Should Teach Those in the Marketplace</strong></a> - Here is a good post on a few simple things pastors can do to equip people in their congregations to be faithful in their vocations.</li>
