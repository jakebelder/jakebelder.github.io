Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>26 January-1 February 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/pXxIMk9haLE">Archbishop Cranmer and the Prayerbook Tradition</a></strong> – Here's a great little video introduction to the idea of common prayer and why it is central to Anglicanism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1i5VKHI">Piety’s Enemy: Sovereign Desire</a></strong> – This is a great post on why the biggest opposition to faith is not secularism, but an alternative vision of human flourishing, which "teaches us that we’re happiest and our society is most just when we’re free to satisfy our desires."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/Rg_33ksyeOY">Walter Brueggemann on the Sabbath</a></strong> – Some really interesting thoughts here from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Brueggemann">Walter Breuggemann</a> on the practice of Sabbath and why rest is so important. He notes in particular that our consumerist culture seeks to suck the life and energy out of us because that's how our culture controls us. As a result, "rested people are dangerous.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Mt6DZH">Siding with Jesus on the Cross</a></strong> – Here's a great piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/scotmcknight">Scot McKnight</a> on how atonement theories only make sense when they begin with the reality that we are guilty sinners.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://nyti.ms/Mt7REd">Alone, Yet Not Alone</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/nytdavidbrooks">David Brooks</a> notes a "yawning gap between the way many believers experience faith and the way that faith is presented to the world," and makes some thoughtful remarks aimed that those who don't consider themselves religious on what faith looks like for believers.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eaxvsK">Resurrection vs. Immortality</a></strong> – This is an excellent piece on the hope of resurrection, looking at the thought of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Cullmann">Oscar Cullmann</a>. The author concludes, "Confronted with death there is a thrill in preaching resurrection. Resurrection declares a boldness of purpose, even in death. The Christian martyr often died with spirited passion, completely unnerving to Socratic dispassion. The martyr knew the call of Christ’s cause, and answered it in hope. He was part of a redemptive story that extended through time and eternity. We do not die into immortality. We die into God."</li>
