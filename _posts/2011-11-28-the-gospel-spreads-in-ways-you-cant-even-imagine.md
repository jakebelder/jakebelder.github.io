<p>A few weeks ago, I preached on the parable of the sower from <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Mk4.1-20">Mark 4</a>, and the week following one of our other ministers, Lee, preached on the parables of the growing seed and the mustard seed. Shortly afterward, I found the video below, which I thought really brought to light some of the things we had said in our sermons, especially emphasizing that when we sow the seed, we just never know where or how it is going to grow. But we have confidence in knowing that God, by the power of the Spirit, will cause it to grow when and in whom he pleases.</p>
<p>We showed it in our evening service last night as a way of encouraging our congregation to be eager to take up the task of proclaiming the Gospel. We wanted them to have that same confidence that when they tell of the good news of the Kingdom of God, it will produce fruit, often even beyond what they could imagine.</p>

This is just so encouraging and uplifting. It is absolutely amazing the way that God works in people's lives.
