<p>Unfortunately, I cannot get my hands on a copy to verify it&mdash;though regardless, I think the point stands&mdash;but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a> reportedly says in his book, <a href="http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_betrayal_of_the_west.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Betrayal of the West</span></a>, that Acts 16:7-8 is perhaps the most pivotal event in Western history:</p>

<blockquote>
And when they had come up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysia">Mysia</a>, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but ï»¿the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.  So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
</blockquote>

This occurs a little less than midway through the second missionary journey. Paul, Silas, and Timothy had journeyed westward across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, what is today modern Turkey, and had attempted to turn north towards the Black Sea into the region of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithynia">Bithynia</a>. However, the Spirit blocked them and they instead continued to head west toward the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Troas">Troas</a>, on the coast of the Aegean Sea. While at Troas, Paul received a vision in which a Macedonian man pleaded with him to sail across to Macedonia, and so they did, entering Europe for the first time, believing that God had called them to preach there (Acts 16:9-10).<br><br>

What this means, of course, was that the Gospel came over to Greece and was introduced to Western civilization.   The rest, as the saying goes, is history.  Instead of remaining in Asia, the Gospel was now planted in the West, churches were established, and Western history and culture were forever changed by the indelible stamp of Christianity.

One can only imagine how history would be different had the Spirit not blocked the early missionaries from going into Bithynia.  Could we even begin to fathom how different this world would look?
