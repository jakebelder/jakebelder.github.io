Forget youth groups or summer camps. [Christian Smith](http://sociology.nd.edu/faculty/faculty-by-alpha/christian-smith/), a sociologist at the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) and lead researcher [of a recent study of faith in young adults](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/the-no-1-reason-teens-kee_b_6067838.html), found that the single most important factor in determining whether or not children maintained their faith into adulthood was their parents. When parents take their faith seriously, encourage conversations about faith in the home, and are active in their local congregations, 82 percent of the time, their children will continue to actively practice their faith into adulthood. The article continues:

<blockquote>
The connection is "nearly deterministic"... Other factors such as youth ministry or clergy or service projects or religious schools pale in comparison. "No other conceivable causal influence...comes remotely close to matching the influence of parents on the religious faith and practices of youth," Smith said in a recent talk sharing the findings at Yale Divinity School. "Parents just dominate."
</blockquote>

In some ways this should not come as a surprise. Scripture frequently emphasises the role of parents in nurturing the faith of their children (think of Deuteronomy 6.1-8 and Proverbs 22.6, for instance), and part of what God promises through the covenant is that he will bless future generations of his faithful people.

But that raises a question – what about children who come to faith as a child or in their teens, who do not have the opportunity to have their faith nurtured by their parents? Does the mean they have little chance of their faith being sustained into adulthood?

Most every church understands that reaching young people is absolutely vital for the ongoing life and mission of the church, and huge amounts of resources and energy are poured into figuring out how to get young people in, and how to keep them in once they are there. But I wonder if this recent study helps us to see that we’re missing something important. Perhaps instead of investing so much into the current models of youth ministry, we should be focusing on enabling and equipping parents in our churches to also be spiritual parents for those children and young people who do not have Christian parents.

What might that look like In practice? Perhaps a set of spiritual parents could ‘adopt’ two young people from their church with the intention of journeying with them and discipling them into adulthood. They would regularly open their home to these young people, share meals together, talk about faith and read the Bible together, foster an environment where young people can ask and work through the big and hard questions they wrestle with, and share life together in such a way that the spiritual parents would regularly be modelling to the young people under their care what it looks like to be a follower of Jesus. They could also be responsible for taking them to church each Sunday so that the young people have mentors to show them what it looks like to participate in the worshipping community. And above all, spiritual parents would be regularly committed to praying for the young people they are responsible for.

If parents really are the key to nurturing and sustaining the faith of young people, then perhaps this is a possible model for youth ministry. Not only does it follow more of a biblical and organic model of discipleship, it brings children and young people more fully into the life of the church, something youth ministry, for all that it does well, often cuts them off from. What's more, these more personal and intimate relationships would give children and young people the opportunity to regularly [see the faith enacted and embodied in ordinary life](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/why-you-should-keep-your-children-in-church). And whilst it would take serious investment and vulnerability on the part of those taking on the role of spiritual parents, it would ensure that children always have an older, wiser, and more mature Christian mentor to look to and learn from.

I am not saying that this is the only answer to the problem of young people walking away from faith and from the church, but if the research is true, then perhaps it is something worth considering. In a context where we sometimes seem to rely too much on a model of youth ministry focused on programmes, something like this would mean re-learning to rely on the power of the Spirit working through the simple things that God has given us – prayer, love, and the means of grace. And that can only be a good thing.
