I have not really read anything from N.T. Wright except a small article a few years ago for a class in university. But I've heard lots about him, and I know many people who think very highly of him. Recently, I read an article in the January 2007 issue of *Christianity Today* in which Wright speaks of presenting the gospel to a postmodern world.

I was caught up in the article right from the beginning, when Wright says that he has spent his whole academic career studying theological issues, but now he wants to step back and ask what it all means. This is, of course, an important task for theologians of any stripe, because that is what it all boils down to. Academic knowledge means nothing without a proper way to apply it, especially in matters relating to faith and life. Wright quotes an old evangelical saying: "If He's not Lord of all, He's not Lord at all." His latest book, *Simply Christian*, focuses on this theme. Says Wright, "We're talking about Jesus as the Lord of the world---not the Lord of people's private spiritual interiority only, but of what they do with their money, with their homes, with the wealth of nations, and with the planet." Bingo!

Wright presupposes the existence of postmodernism in his latest work, and it is very evident in his approach. To him, the Bible must be viewed first and foremost as a story, and "we've got to pay attention to that, rather than abstracting dogmatic points from it. The dogmas matter, they are true, but you have to join them up in the right way." He also states that we don't really know who God is, and have to start with Jesus in order to understand God, which is the opposite way from which a lot of modernist orthodoxy approaches it. As a caution he says, "Don't assume that you've got God taped, and fit Jesus into that. Do it the other way. We all come with some ideas of God. Allow those ideas to be shaped around Jesus. That is the real challenge of New Testament Christology."

However, Wright does not accept postmodernism without batting an eye. He points to the fault of modernism as removing the narrative element from the Bible, but then immediately turns around and accuses postmodernism of focusing on the narrative without paying attention to the fact that the story is true. He calls postmodernity 20th-century Gnosticism, a response to the failure of modernism just as Jewish Gnosticism was a response to the perceived failure of early Christianity. People are looking for something different, something to answer the question of what it is all about when they see a world around them gone to pieces. But, as Wright says, "the great emphasis in the New Testament is that the gospel is not how to escape the world; the gospel is that the crucified and risen Jesus is the Lord of the world...[and] you, in turn, can be part of that transforming work."

The Kingdom of Jesus Christ is certainly not of this world, but it is for this world. That's an important point. Once you start with that, your whole perception changes, and you begin to wonder how things like religion and real life, or faith and politics can be separated. Another interesting point Wright makes is wondering how Christians have said the Lord's Prayer for centuries without really meaning it. It all begins with worship. We need to be worshiping the God who created the world out of His boundless, self-giving love. We need to reciprocate this. That is the beginning of mission in our current cultural context, and for that matter, in any context.
