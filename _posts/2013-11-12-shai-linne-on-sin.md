Though my musical tastes are diverse, I've never really had an appreciation for rap or hip-hop, and therefore, with the exception of having heard his name mentioned in various places, I have largely remained unacquainted with [Shai Linne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Linne). What I do know, however, is that his music is deeply theological, which is one of the reasons a number of people I know really like his stuff.

That theology is important to Linne is clear from these lyrics I came across the other day, from his song, 'All Consuming Fire', featured on the album *[The Attributes of God](http://www.amazon.com/The-Attributes-God-Shai-Linne/dp/B005VDB3CU/ref=tmm_other_meta_binding_title_0)*, which contain a great definition of sin as it relates to who God is:

<blockquote>
The glory of God is not honored.<br>
The holiness of God is not reverenced.<br>
The greatness of God is not admired.<br>
The power of God is not praised.<br>
The truth of God is not sought.<br>
The wisdom of God is not esteemed.<br>
The beauty of God is not treasured.<br>
The goodness of God is not savored.<br>
The faithfulness of God is not trusted.<br>
The promises of God are not relied upon.<br>
The commandments of God are not obeyed.<br>
The justice of God is not respected.<br>
The wrath of God is not feared.<br>
The grace of God is not cherished.<br>
The presence of God is not prized.<br>
The person of God is not loved.<br>
That is sin.
</blockquote>

I've quoted [James K.A. Smith](http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith) in a previous post, who notes that [sin can never just be understood as an intellectual problem](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/sin-is-not-merely-an-intellectual-problem) because it is less about failing to live according to what we *know* as it is about disordered loves and desires that have been shaped by rival liturgies seeking to drive us away from God. I think Linne would affirm that.

But what, then, is the corrective? What rightly reorders our loves and desires? Worship that focuses us time and again on the glory, the holiness, the greatness, the power, the truth, the wisdom, the beauty, the goodness, the faithfulness, the promises, the commandments, the justice, the wrath, the grace, the presence, and the person of God.
