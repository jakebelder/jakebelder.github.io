<p>Preaching the message of the Kingdom of God was by all means the most important activity of Jesus during His ministry on earth.  Indeed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Nicolaas_Ridderbos">Herman Ridderbos</a> notes in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Kingdom-Herman-N-Ribberbos/dp/0875524087"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Coming of the Kingdom</span></a>, that "Jesus' miracles nowhere serve as a purpose but always as a means in his activities, and always remain subservient to the preaching of the gospel" (115).  Still, his miracles do make a very specific and significant point.  Ridderbos observes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
Jesus' miracles have an eschatalogical character as messianic deeds of salvation...the cure of diseased persons, the raising of the dead, etc., are to be considered as the renewal and the re-creation of all things, manifesting the coming of the kingdom of heaven (115).
</blockquote>

<p>This means that, for example, Jesus' acts of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%209&amp;version=31">healing the man born blind</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011;&amp;version=31;">raising Lazarus from the dead</a>, and healing the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%208:40-48;&amp;version=31;">woman afflicted by continuous bleeding</a>, are to be understood as a foreshadowing and a foretaste of the restoration that is to come when the Kingdom of God arrives in fullness at the second coming of Christ.  Ridderbos says,</p>

<blockquote>
the miracles wrought by Jesus...indicate the coming of the kingdom and point to the cosmic palingenesis mentioned in <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?new=1&amp;word=matthew+19%3A28&amp;section=0&amp;version=niv&amp;language=en">Matthew 19:28</a>...this palingenesis is something of the future world aeon; because it embodies the resurrection of the dead and the renewal of the world...a miracle is both a demonstration of Jesus' power over the Evil One and a sign of the future palingenesis (119-120).
</blockquote>

The Greek word found in Matthew 19:28, &pi;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;á½·&alpha;, has a deeply significant meaning.  It is to be understood as denoting "the restoration of a thing to its pristine state, its renovation, as a renewal or restoration of life after death" (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=3824&amp;version=nas">source</a>).  It is no mere coincidence that Jesus uses this word to refer to what will come to fruition when He returns to usher in the fullness of the Kingdom at His second coming.   The implications of understanding this are great; the implications of <span style="font-style: italic;">misunderstanding</span> this are far greater.
