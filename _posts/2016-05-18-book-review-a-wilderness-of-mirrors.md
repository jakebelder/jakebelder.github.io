<p>I have a tendency to be too trusting of people. It has gotten me into trouble a few times, mostly involving me losing small amounts of money. However, I am aware that in this respect, I am unusual; trust in others is something notably lacking in modern Western culture. A few minutes on Twitter looking at political commentary is all the proof you need of this. Cynicism characterises the reality we live in, and it is this cynical world that Mark Meynell engages in his latest book, <a href="http://amzn.to/1U3ivPm"><em>A Wilderness of Mirrors: Trusting Again in a Cynical World</em></a> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2015, 223pp., £11.99). His question is simple: Is there a way out of this cynicism?</p>

<p><em>A Wilderness of Mirrors</em> is broken up into three main sections, and in the first part, Mark offers a thorough analysis of the cultural history that has led to the breakdown of trust in society. He paints a bleak picture – with detailed attention to events like the World Wars and their impact on Western society, to the way that information is mediated to us and deception we are often subjected to, as well as the failure of powerful institutions to care for us, we are offered every reason to be deeply cynical. Even an optimist like me genuinely felt my inherent trust in others completely shattered.</p>

<p>And I’m not alone. The second section of the book offers a further analysis of the way this breakdown of trust has affected people, creating a culture of suspicion and paranoia that births all kinds of conspiracy theories, providing the foundation for the deconstruction of the reality we thought we knew, leaving people feeling isolated and deeply uncertain about anything. It is at this point that Mark gets personal, as he articulates his own struggle with depression, fear, and anger at the world.</p>

<p>But that struggle opens the door for the third section of the book, where Mark offers a compelling vision for overcoming the cynicism we all experience to one degree or another. He first brings us to the fundamental root of the problems of the modern world – ourselves, and our propensity to live in God’s world as if it were our own. For Mark, there is only one solution: Jesus. In Jesus, we can begin to build trust again in a cynical world because Jesus shows us how power and authority are used for the flourishing of others, as he serves, loves, and even sacrifices himself for us. This good news, Mark stresses, is the only antidote to keeping us from falling into the cynicism all around us. And more, in my favourite chapter of the book, Mark paints a beautiful picture of how the church can be the community in which we together inhabit the story that redeems our cynicism, where we together learn to walk in the way of Jesus. Thus the church can become the safest place on earth, as we together begin to discover what it looks like when people all seek to serve one another in love, freeing us from our cynicism as we get a taste of a reality where we are not lied to or used for the advantage of others.<p>

<p><em>A Wilderness of Mirrors</em> is well-researched, drawing from all kinds of disciplines and theological traditions, filled with interesting and captivating stories, and all the more engaging because of Mark’s own personal journey through cynicism and depression. He makes a compelling case for why Jesus is the ultimate answer to our disillusionment with so much of reality, and we are left encouraged in the knowledge that, as Julian of Norwich said, ‘All shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well!'</p>
