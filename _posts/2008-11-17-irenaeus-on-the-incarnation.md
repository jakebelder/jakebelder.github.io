Echoing what we discover in passages such as Romans 5:12-21 and Hebrews 2:14-18, [St. Irenaeus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) sums up the wonder of the incarnation of Christ with these simple words:

<blockquote>
Because of His measureless love, He became what we are in order to enable us to become what He is.
</blockquote>

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
