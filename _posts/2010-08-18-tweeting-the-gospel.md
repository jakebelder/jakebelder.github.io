<p><a href="http://bradley.chattablogs.com/abraham-sangha.html">Abraham Sangha</a>, one of the contributors for the blog, <a href="http://bradley.chattablogs.com/">The Institute</a>, mentioned in his <a href="http://bradley.chattablogs.com/archives/2010/08/twitter-and-the.html">most recent post</a> that he was once asked how you would tweet the gospel, to which he  quickly replied, "You don't." I'm inclined to agree with him.</p>
<p>In recent months, I've noticed that some people involved in church ministry have increasingly been using <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> as a platform for talking &ndash; though perhaps it would be better to call it preaching &ndash; about the gospel, in some cases almost exclusively (I'll attribute it to mere coincidence that this started to happen with more regularity <a href="http://www.youseedrybones.com/piper-ruined-twitter/">once John Piper started tweeting</a>). Below, I pulled a sample of some of these tweets so you could see what I'm talking about:</p><br><br>

<p>Reading the sample tweets I've posted above, there were a few things that came to mind. First, while I don't disagree with anything said above (although I might word them differently), these short tweets are lacking context. Now, in the case of the persons who tweeted these things, the vast majority of their followers will be Christians, with many likely coming from a similar tradition of the Twitter user and able to supply the needed context. In one sense, then, they are preaching to the choir. But perhaps one of their followers is in a place where they need to hear one of these messages, and are encouraged by it.</p>
<p>However, if you have people following you who are not Christians, none of this will likely make any sense to them. And though having followers who aren't Christians shouldn't stop you from tweeting thoughts that resonate with you or inspire you, it is worthwhile to consider your audience and the medium of the message. One other thing bearing consideration is the nature of social media relationships &ndash; is there some semblance of a personal relationship when following someone on Twitter such that you are sharing the gospel in the context of relationship, or is tweeting the gospel a 21st century varient of tract evangelism?</p>
<p>Secondly, these types of tweets seem to restrict the gospel message to the singular idea that we are saved by God's grace apart from anything we can do. While this is entirely true and was one of the major themes of the message Jesus came to proclaim, is this all the gospel is about? What about Jesus' proclamation of the Kingdom of God? The presentations of the gospel that come out of this recent Twitter trend seems to focus solely on personal salvation and individual piety. Again, while these are parts of the gospel, it is not the whole message. Is it a good practice to present bits and pieces of the gospel 140 characters at a time?</p>

At any rate, I am probably reading too much into it this, and could just be missing the point. These are just some of my initial reactions to this increasing trend of tweeting the gospel. What do you think? If you like to tweet the gospel, why do you do so? Can you really present the gospel in 140 characters?
