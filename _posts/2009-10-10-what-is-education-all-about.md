<p>As someone who plans to be involved in education, this bit from <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.jameskasmith.com">Jamie Smith's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desiring-Kingdom-Worldview-Formation-Liturgies/dp/0801035775"><span style="font-style: italic;">Desiring the Kindgom</span></a>, is music to my ears.</p>
<blockquote>
What is education <span style="font-style: italic;">for</span>? And more specifically, what is at stake in a distinctively Christian education? What does the qualifier <span style="font-style: italic;">Christian</span> mean when appended to education? It is usually understood that education is about ideas and information (though it is also too often routinely reduced to credentialing for a career and viewed as a ticket to a job). And so distinctively <span style="font-style: italic;">Christian</span> education is understood to be about Christian ideas&mdash;which usually requires a defense of the importance of "the life of the mind." On this account, the goal of a Christian education is the development of a Christian perspective, or more commonly now, a Christian <span style="font-style: italic;">worldview</span>, which is taken to be a system of Christian beliefs, ideas, and doctrines.<br /><br />

But what if this line of thinking gets off on the wrong foot? What if education, including higher education, is not primarily about the absorption of ideas and information, but about the <span style="font-style: italic;">formation</span> of hearts and desires? What if we began by appreciating how education not only gets into our head but also (and more fundamentally) grabs us by the gut&mdash;what the New Testament refers to as <span style="font-style: italic;">kardia</span>, "the heart"? What if education was primarily concerned with shaping our hopes and passions&mdash;our visions of the "the good life"&mdash;and not merely about the dissemination of data and information as inputs to our thinking? What if the primary work of education was the transforming of our imagination rather than the saturation of our intellect? And what if this had as much to do with our bodies as with our minds?<br /><br />

What if education wasn't first and foremost about what we know, but about what we love? (17-18)</blockquote>

The copy of the book I have right now is from the library, but having read the introduction and a bit of the first chapter, I am convinced that it needs to be on my shelf.
