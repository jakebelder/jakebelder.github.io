I have paid the price once again for attempting to use a start-up blog host. First it was Posterous that bit the dust, and now Scriptogram, whom I currently use to host this blog, [have announced they are shutting down as well](http://scriptogr.am/blog/post/important-information).

So what am I going to do with this blog? After a lot of thought, I have decided to pull the plug on it altogether. It has been a good 12 years, but it is time to bring my blogging career to an end. On the one hand, I don't want to deal with the hassle of migrating a blog somewhere else again. But more significantly, I've felt for a while now that I simply don't want to write here any longer. Whilst I've enjoyed it a great deal over the years, it is time for something different.

I want to find a way to keep the archives online, but I'm not sure how I am going to do that yet. Once I have figured it out, I will share the information on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder). For now, there will be a link on my new '[landing page](http://jakebelder.com)', but as per [Scriptogram's announcement](http://scriptogr.am/blog/post/important-information), that will only be active until 15 August.

But for now, I sincerely want to thank all of you who have read and commented on this blog over the years. Not only have I met a lot of great people through this medium, but I have had my thinking sharpened through the stimulating conversations it has generated. That is what has truly made blogging a delight.

Grace and peace to all of you.
