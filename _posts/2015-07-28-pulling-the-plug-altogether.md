I have paid the price once again for attempting to use a start-up blog host. First it was Posterous that bit the dust, and now Scriptogram, whom I currently use to host this blog, [have announced they are shutting down as well](http://scriptogr.am/blog/post/important-information).

So what am I going to do with this blog? After a lot of thought, I have decided to pull the plug on it altogether. It has been a good 12 years, but it is time to bring my blogging career to an end. On the one hand, I don't want to deal with the hassle of migrating a blog somewhere else again. But more significantly, I've felt for a while now that I simply don't want to write here any longer. Whilst I've enjoyed it a great deal over the years, it is time for something different.

Thanks to the generous help of [Anthony Smith](http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith), the archives will continue to be available online. You will be able to access them via a link on my new '[landing page](http://jakebelder.com)'.

For now, I sincerely want to thank all of you who have read and commented on this blog over the years. Not only have I met a lot of great people through this medium, but I have had my thinking sharpened through the stimulating conversations it has generated. That is what has truly made blogging a delight.

Grace and peace to all of you.
