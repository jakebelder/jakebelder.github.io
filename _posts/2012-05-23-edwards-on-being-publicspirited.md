<p>Jonathan Edwards, in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/143352970X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=143352970X"><em>Charity and Its Fruits</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
And as the spirit of charity, or  Christian love, is opposed to a  selfish spirit, in that it is merciful and  liberal, so it is in this,  also, that it <em>disposes  a person to be public-spirited</em>. A man  of a right spirit is not a man of  narrow and private views, but is  greatly interested and concerned for the good  of the community to which  he belongs, and particularly of the city or village  in which he  resides, and for the true welfare of the society of which he is a   member. God commanded the Jews that were carried away captive to Babylon  to seek the good  of that city, though it was not their native place,  but only the city of their  captivity. His injunction was (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/.7"></a>Jeremiah 29:7),  "Seek the peace of the city  whither I have caused you to be carried  away captives, and pray unto the Lord  for it." And a man of truly  Christian spirit will be earnest for the good  of his country, and of  the place of his residence, and will be disposed to lay  himself out for  its improvement.
