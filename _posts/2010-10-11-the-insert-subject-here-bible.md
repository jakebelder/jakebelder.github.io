My friend, Tom, mentioned yesterday in his sermon that if you type "Bible" into the search box at Amazon.com, you get about 285,000 results. Half of them are different versions of the Bible itself, while the other half are various instruction manuals on different subjects: *The Triathlete's Training Bible*, *The New Optimum Nutrition Bible*, *The Social Media Bible*, *The Baby Food Bible*, *Race Tech's Motorcycle Suspension Bible*, *The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible*, and the list goes on (and on and on and on).

The strange thing, of course, is that we live in a culture which, by and large, has no regard anymore for the authority and relevance of the Bible. Yet, marketer's continue to use the word in the titles of their books, hoping these books will emerge as the authorities on various subjects. It just seems odd that despite our culture's best efforts to do away with the authority of Bible, they will contentedly use the word to refer to something of supreme authority. Old definitions die hard, I suppose.
