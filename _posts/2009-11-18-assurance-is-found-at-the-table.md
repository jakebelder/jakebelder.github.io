<p>When talking about the assurance of salvation, we often look to Scripture for the promises of God's faithfulness, such as we find in Romans 10:9, or we point to the work of the Holy Spirit in assuring us of our faith (see <a href="http://crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_deliver.cfm#QandA%2021">Heidelberg Catechism Q&amp;A 21</a>). Yet, especially in Reformed circles, we seldom mention the assurance that comes to us in the Lord's Supper. Consider what <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Bavinck">Herman Bavinck</a> has to say in the fourth volume of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Dogmatics-Baker-Publishing-Group/dp/0801035767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258590378&amp;sr=8-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Reformed Dogmatics</span></a> on the profound nature of the Supper:</p>
<blockquote>
Of primary importance in the Lord's Supper is what God does, not what we do. The Lord's Supper is above all a gift of God, a benefit of Christ, a means of communicating his grace. If the Lord's Supper were only a memorial meal and an act of confession, it would cease to be a sacrament in the true sense. In that case, like prayer, it could only be obliquely and indirectly called a means of grace. The Lord's Supper, however, is on the same level as the Word and baptism and therefore must, like them, be regarded first of all as a message and assurance to us of divine grace.<br /><br />

...[Christ] makes of [the] elements a meal in which the disciples consume his body and blood and thus enter into the most intimate communion with him. This communion does not merely consist in their sitting at one table, but they eat one and the same bread and drink one and the same wine. Indeed, the host here, in granting the signs of bread and wine, offers his own body and blood as nourishment and refreshment for their souls. That is a communion that far surpasses the communion inherent in a memorial meal and an act of confession. It is not merely a reminiscence of or a reflection on Christ's benefits but a most intimate bonding with Christ himself, just as food and drink are united with the body.<br /><br />

...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin">Calvin</a>, accordingly, correctly remarked against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli">Zwingli</a> that the meaning of eating Christ's body and drinking his blood is not exhausted by believing. Believing is a means, a means that is even temporary and destined to become seeing, but the communion with Christ engendered by it goes much deeper and endures forever. It is a mystical union that can only be made somewhat clear to us by the images of the vine and the branch, the head and the body, a bridegroom and his bride, the cornerstone and the building that rests on it. It is this mystical union that is signified and sealed in the Lord's Supper.
</blockquote>
<p>Often there seems to be a hesitancy in Reformed circles to say too much about the Lord's Supper for fear of sounding like some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consubstantiation">Lutherans</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation">Roman Catholics</a>. Yet perhaps the opposite then becomes a problem as well, and they end up saying too <span style="font-style: italic;">little</span> about it. It is not uncommon to hear the charge that the Reformed understand of the Lord's Supper is much more Zwinglian than Calvinist, and while the accusation might not be entirely fair, you can see the warrant for it. When a church holds the Lord's Supper only four or five times a year and goes to great lengths to emphasize the symbolic and memorial nature of it, it severely diminishes the significance of it.</p>

<p>But the invitation to the table is an invitation to enter into intimate communion with Christ. It is an invitation to "taste and see that the Lord is good" (Ps. 34:8). It is an invitation to be united with Christ when physically partaking of the elements. It is an invitation to have a foretaste of the coming marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:6-10). It is an invitation to <span style="font-style: italic;">receive</span>&mdash;not just to remember&mdash;His grace.</p>

If you do not believe that the Supper actually <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> something in the first place, there is no impetus to frequently come to the table. But when you truly understand the Supper as a means of grace, how could you not run to the table at Christ's invitation to receive that grace as often as you can?
