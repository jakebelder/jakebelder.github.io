<p>Stefan Paas is a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam, holding the <a href="http://www.godgeleerdheid.vu.nl/nl/organisatie/medewerkers/wetenschappelijk-personeel-m-s/paas.asp">J.H. Bavinck Chair for Church Planting and Church Renewal</a>. He was at the recent <a href="http://www.citytocityeurope.com">Redeemer City to City Europe </a>conference in Berlin where he gave a talk entitled "A European Perspective on Church Planting." If you're involved in ministry in the UK or Europe, I think you'll find this to be very interesting. He raises a lot of important questions to consider about the nature of ministry here and the vision and aims of the church on this continent.</p>
