<p>Every week I use Twitter to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted the following Monday. For the sake of ease, however, I've put all of July together in this post.</p>
<p>Here are the links from <strong>July 2012</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://blogs.christianpost.com/guest-views/the-17-most-misused-verses-in-the-bible-10176/" target="_blank"><strong>The 17 Most Misused Verses in the Bible</strong></a> &ndash; I find lists like this quite interesting. It is always a temptation to read bits of the Bible out of context, and some verses have become so often used out of context that nobody bats an eye anymore. What do you think of this list? Is there any you would add?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/faith-healing.html?paging=off" target="_blank"><strong>Faith Healing: How Local Churches Are Stepping into Health Care</strong></a> &ndash; Another interesting and encouraging story from the <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/" target="_blank">This is Our City</a> project highlighting how Christians are working for the common good in their cities.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/breathing-life-into-the-dry-bones-of-ancient-corinth-witheringtons-week-in-the-life/" target="_blank"><strong>Breathing life into the dry bones of ancient Corinth: Witherington's Week in the Life</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> reviews a new book by <a href="http://www.benwitherington.com/" target="_blank">Ben Witherington</a> called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0830839623/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0830839623" target="_blank">A Week in the Life of Corinth</a></em>. Written as a novel, the book is intended to really give a flavour of life in ancient Corinth at the time of Paul, and it looks to be very interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daVDrGsaDME&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><strong>11 Months, 3000 pictures and a lot of coffee.</strong></a> &ndash; This guy stripped down and rebuilt an engine, and put all the photos together into an absolutely fantastic stop-motion film. You simply have to watch this.</li>
<li><a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/adam-was-gardener-not-farmer.html" target="_blank"><strong>Adam was a gardener, not a farmer</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/ugleyvicar" target="_blank">John Richardson</a> explores the cultural mandate and our creative calling in this world, and works towards a biblical view of work.</li>
<li><a href="http://deidox.com/" target="_blank"><strong>DEIDOX: 5-minute films that document the faith of everyday people</strong></a> &ndash; This is a new project, which really looks great. From their website, "Deidox is a new series of short documentary films exploring the faith of  everyday people. We are on a journey to find practical examples of what  it looks like to live a life of faith." Do be sure to click through and watch a few of them. There are some beautiful stories here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/3362/church-practices-and-public-life-recovering-the-practice-of-communal-singing" target="_blank"><strong>Church Practices and Public Life: Recovering the Practice of Communal Singing</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://byzantinecalvinist.blogspot.com" target="_blank">David Koyzis</a> writes, "[We] are gradually losing the social capital that facilitates co-operation in  a variety of venues. The decline of occasions for singing together is  perhaps a symptom, and possibly even a contributing cause, of this loss.  Could it be that we will reinvigorate our social and political culture  by turning off our private mp3 players, pulling out the earphones, and  joining our voices together in song? It might just be worth a try."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better.html" target="_blank"><strong>5 ways to listen better</strong></a> &ndash; In this <a href="http://www.ted.com" target="_blank">TED</a> talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/julian_treasure.html" target="_blank">Julian Treasure</a>, who studies sound for a living, talks about learning to listen better, something we all need to learn. He offers some practical tips, which are very helpful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.calvin.edu/meeter/Was%20Calvin%20a%20Calvinist-12-26-09.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Was Calvin a Calvinist? [PDF]</strong></a> &ndash; This is an interesting article by <a href="https://calvinseminary.edu/about/profiles/richard-muller/" target="_blank">Richard Muller</a> on defining the Reformed tradition. He addresses the use and meaning of the term 'Calvinist' as well as the tendency to reduce Calvinism to the five points that make up the well-known 'TULIP'.</li>
<li><a href="http://theresurgence.com/2012/07/06/get-to-know-saint-patrick" target="_blank"><strong>Get to Know Saint Patrick</strong></a> &ndash; ...but not by following this link. This is one of Mark Driscoll's biographies, although I'd hesitate to call it that because of the flawed historiography he employs; namely, making history say what he wants it to say. Patrick essentially comes off as a fifth century Driscoll who planted a bunch of Mars Hill churches in Ireland.</li>
<li><a href="http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/london-2012-olympic-fascism.html" target="_blank"><strong>London 2012 Olympic fascism</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace" target="_blank">Cranmer</a> discusses the ridiculous restrictions being imposed by those running the games.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtoninst.org/2226/to-dwell-in-a-household-menial-work-meaning-and-motherhood/" target="_blank"><strong>To Dwell in a Household: Menial Work, Meaning, and Motherhood</strong></a> &ndash; An encouraging post on the blessing of 'menial' work. The author writes, "'Menial' work [is] work that cares for people and knits together a common  life&mdash;or community&mdash;built around the shared and humble needs that comprise  regular daily living... Devoting ourselves to the good of others begins  with demonstrating love and service to those nearest us."</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://nyti.ms/LqIqA8" target="_blank">Can Liberal Christianity Be Saved?</a></strong> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT" target="_blank">Ross Douthat</a>, in this interesting post, says no. In response to this, also check out <a href="http://twitter.com/SteveRHolmes" target="_blank">Steve Holmes</a> helpful post on <a href="http://shoredfragments.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/defining-liberal-christianity/" target="_blank">defining liberal Christianity</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://nyti.ms/NuQwVk" target="_blank"><strong>Individualism in Overdrive</strong></a> &ndash; This article hits the nail on the head. Frank Bruni writes, "Selfishness run amok is a national disease.  Too many people behave as if they live in a civic vacuum, no broader  implications to their individual behavior." </li>
<li><a href="http://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2012/07/17/time-for-the-church-to-cut-the-knot" target="_blank"><strong>Time for the Church to cut the knot</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="http://klice.co.uk/index.php/about/people/staff" target="_blank">Jonathan Chaplin</a> makes a pretty convincing case for why the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org" target="_blank">Church of England</a> should move towards disestablishment.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18789154" target="_blank"><strong>The eurozone's religious faultline</strong></a> &ndash; This is quite an interesting analysis of the role of religion in the Eurozone crisis. In particular, the impact of Protestantism on economics is noted as a positive thing, and one German commentator is quoted saying, "Too much Catholicism is detrimental to a nation's fiscal health, even today in the 21st century." </li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/the-dehumanising-metrics-of-modernist-ministry-part-1/" target="_blank"><strong>The dehumanising metrics of modernist ministry (part 1)</strong></a> &ndash; Here's a great post by <a href="https://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> on how modernism shapes our ministry, and how we need to respond to it. </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://byzantinecalvinist.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/liberal-and-conservative-christianity.html" target="_blank">Liberal and Conservative Christianity...and 'in between'</a></strong> &ndash; David Koyzis discusses the idea of being caught between two opposite poles on the spectrum, but cautions an approach that makes oneself the referential standpoint: "It would be presumptuous of me to stand in judgement on various Christian communities for not conforming to <em>my</em> checklist."</li>
<li><a href="http://stackblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/christianity-the-worst-source-of-evil/" target="_blank"><strong>Christianity the Worst Source of Evil?</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/jgsphd" target="_blank">John Stackhouse, Jr.</a> answers the claim of many opponents of religion, and Christianity in particular, that the latter is inherently hateful or violent.</li>
<li><a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/triggering-and-triggered-1/" target="_blank"><strong>On Triggering and the Triggered, Part 1</strong></a> &ndash; Even if you are on the fringe of evangelicalism, you will no doubt have heard about the now infamous post on <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/" target="_blank">The Gospel Coalition blog</a> by <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/gospeldrivenchurch/" target="_blank">Jared Wilson</a> in which he quoted <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/" target="_blank">Doug Wilson</a> on a view of marital sex that didn't sit well with a lot of people. There are, as you would expect, a thousand different responses to all of this, but <a href="http://twitter.com/zugzwanged" target="_blank">Alastair Roberts'</a> analysis of the whole situation is very helpful. Since then, the post has been removed from the TGC site and Jared Wilson has <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/gospeldrivenchurch/2012/07/20/some-reflections-just-one-explanation-and-apologies/" target="_blank">issued an apology</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cardus.ca/blog/2012/07/america-is-not-the-greatest/" target="_blank"><strong>America Is Not The Greatest</strong></a> &ndash; The Cardus blog features a clip from the HBO programme, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/" target="_blank"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>. It's a fascinating clip in which the lead character spends a few minutes debunking the idea that America is the greatest. Some have described it as the most honest three minutes on television. <em>[WARNING: strong language.]</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alban.org/conversation.aspx?id=9972" target="_blank"><strong>How Your Congregation Learns</strong></a> &ndash; This is quite an interesting post with the results of a study done by the <a href="https://centerforcongregations.org/" target="_blank">Indianapolis Center for Congregations</a> to determine how to best foster growth in knowledge and faith in congregations.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/my-adoptive-family-is-my-real-family/article4431608/" target="_blank"><strong>My adoptive family is my real family</strong></a> &ndash; A beautiful story in the Canadian newspaper, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Globe and Mail</em></a>, from someone who was adopted as an infant on who her real family is.</li>
<li><a href="http://markmeynell.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/the-dehumanising-metrics-of-modernist-ministry-2-the-future/" target="_blank"><strong>The dehumanising metrics of modernist ministry 2: The Future</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/Quaerentia" target="_blank">Mark Meynell</a> posts part two of his series, this time looking at the problems of operating with a view that progress is inevitable, and the pitfalls of the ideas of 'strategy' and 'novelty'. Another great post, well worth reading if you're in ministry.</li>
<li><a href="http://stockholmchurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/reaching-a-society-without-god/" target="_blank"><strong>Reaching a society without God</strong></a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/simplepastor" target="_blank">Phil Whittall</a> discusses some of the difficulties of church planting in Scandinavia, but also some encouraging news about some of the work going on there. Scandinavia is a part of the world I've had a longstanding interest in, and to hear of churches being planted there is an answer to prayer.</li>
<li><a href="http://bibleandmission.redcliffe.org/2012/07/24/free-access-to-thomas-schirrmachers-world-mission-book/" target="_blank"><strong>Free access to Thomas Schirrmacher&rsquo;s World Mission book</strong></a> &ndash; Free books are always good, and this one has been made available as a PDF. It looks to be interesting. I don't really know much about <a href="http://www.thomasschirrmacher.net/eine-seite/short-biography/" target="_blank">Thomas Schirrmacher</a>, but the contents of the book look intriguing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.turtlebayandbeyond.org/2012/abortion/the-prince-of-liechtenstein-risks-his-crown-and-defeats-the-abortion-lobby/" target="_blank"><strong>Noblesse Oblige: The Prince of Liechtenstein risks his crown &ndash; and defeats the abortion lobby</strong></a> &ndash; This is a very interesting story about a very interesting political move by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois,_Hereditary_Prince_of_Liechtenstein" target="_blank">hereditary prince</a> to keep abortion illegal in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein" target="_blank">Liechtenstein</a>. How many other leaders around the world would be willing to go so far in order not to violate their conscience?</li>
