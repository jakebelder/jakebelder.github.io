<p><a href="http://cpjustice.org/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a>, recently-appointed director of the <a href="http://www.cpjustice.org/">Center for Public Justice</a>, has been running a wonderful series <a href="http://cpjustice.org/gideonstrauss">on his blog</a> about what American evangelicals need in order to properly think about politics.  <a href="http://cpjustice.org/gideonstrauss/2009/06/06/what-do-evangelicals-need-9/">In one of the latest installments</a>, he quotes Timothy Wiens, <a href="http://www.bostontrinity.org/about/">headmaster of the Boston Trinity Academy</a>, who says this:</p>

<blockquote>
It is my belief that American evangelicals, first and foremost, lack a true understanding of the Bible and Biblical principles.  When it comes to making decisions about politics, about justice, about our time and our money, too often we lack a foundational understanding of scripture, of the Good News of the Gospel, and of the historical story of the Bible &ndash; creation, fall, and redemption.<br /><br />

So many evangelicals in America have bought into our nation&rsquo;s consumer mentality and end up in church so that they may simply receive from God.  If we examine the worship songs that are so often sung, this becomes glaringly apparent.  They seem to center on &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;my needs&rdquo; and thanking God for all He has given us and has done for us rather than reflecting what worship ought to center on, the character and nature of an amazing, sovereign God.  Worship should be that, worship &ndash; adoration of a perfect and holy God.<br /><br />

Likewise, too many evangelical pastors wish to pacify and promote simple happiness or success.  For example, one popular evangelical church in the city in which I live states their mission is to &ldquo;seek to empower impossibly great lives.&rdquo;  I am not sure such self promotion and such self-empowerment has anything to do with the truth of the Gospel. (Actually, I am fairly certain it does not!).  Joel Osteen suggests his mission is to promote our &ldquo;best life now.&rdquo;  These are simply two of many of today&rsquo;s evangelicals with broad influence.<br /><br />

James in his epistle, chapter one, is very specific in regard to what it looks like to be a Christian.  He states in verse 27, &ldquo;Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained form the world.&rdquo;  It is clear, when we look through the context of the Scriptures, that we are to help those who cannot help themselves, and even as Jesus did, help those who, in many cases, chose not to help themselves (prostitutes, tax collectors, and myriad other scoundrels to be sure).  Micah 6:8 suggests, &ldquo;He has told you, O man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo;<br /><br />

As evangelicals seek to understand the Gospel, truth, and justice, the promotion of God&rsquo;s kingdom here on earth will certainly be a by-product.  Better understanding redemption and grace will enable evangelicals to rightly discern truth as it pertains to our responsibilities in the political and social realm.

Wiens' understanding of the holistic, transformational power of the Gospel is what stands out so pertinently here.  He is exactly right to note that this is what is missing from American evangelicalism, and that if good and helpful engagement with politics is ever to happen, a renewed heart is the precursor.
