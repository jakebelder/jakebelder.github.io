This video is really quite interesting. A number of scholars are gathered at [Tyndale House](http://www.tyndalehouse.com/) in Cambridge to discuss the different ideas of the word 'slave' and how it should be used in an upcoming revision of the English Standard Version of the Bible. If nothing else, it's a great window into what goes on behind the scenes as we wrestle to translate Scripture into our own language without losing the meaning and emphasis of the original text.
