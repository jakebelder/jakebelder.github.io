<p>The General Synod of the <a href="http://cofe.anglican.org">Church of England</a> took place this past week in London. <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-church-of-england-general-synod-and-the-a">I mentioned it earlier this week</a>, referencing particularly the debate that was to occur regarding the Church of England's relationship with the Anglican Church in North America, since that was the most interesting item on the agenda for me. Below is the video recording of Lorna Ashworth presenting her Private Member's Motion. You can also watch the debate that followed (<a href="http://www.anglicantv.org/content/coe-2010-acna-motion-debate-part-i">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.anglicantv.org/content/coe-2010-acna-motion-debate-part-ii">part 2</a>).</p>

<p>Also of interest was the address by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. He addressed the idea of human freedom and emphasized the need to listen and learn from each other.</p>

If you refer to <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-church-of-england-general-synod-and-the-a">my earlier post</a>, I provided a variety of links with more reading on Synod. Those sites now have their post-Synod thoughts online, offering a variety of viewpoints on what transpired. Also, you can find the official press release from the ACNA <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net/?/main/page/76">online here</a>.
