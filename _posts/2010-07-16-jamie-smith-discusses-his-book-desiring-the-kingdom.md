<p><a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">Jamie Smith</a>, professor of philosophy at Calvin College, published a book in the fall of last year called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desiring-Kingdom-Worldview-Formation-Liturgies/dp/0801035775">Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation</a></em>, which was probably the best book I read in 2009. I was a little late in noticing this, but in January he gave a lecture at Calvin that highlighted the main themes of the book. The lecture is excellent (as is the book, which you definitely should read), and there is a lot to glean from it. Enjoy.</p>
