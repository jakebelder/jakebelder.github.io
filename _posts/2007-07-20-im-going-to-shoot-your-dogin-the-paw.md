Author and historian Gary Wills discusses the origins of the office of the pope in the Catholic Church. In a section about the apostle Peter, he says, following the thought of G. K. Chesterton:

<blockquote>
Peter is a recognizably complex human being. Into a story that has sometimes the air of a fairy tale and sometimes that of a nightmare, he seems to have come straight out of the pages of a Dostoevski novel. He is the comic boaster who bungles everything. His fourth-century cultists...tried to make him the new Moses. But the Gospels make him less a Moses than a Mister Magoo. A man of action, he invariably takes the wrong action. In the garden where Jesus is arrested, he is not only inept but ridiculous. With armed soldiers collaring his leader, he attacks a nearby servant---in the ear. As a journalist I know would say, this does not show an instinct for the jugular but an instinct for the capillary. It is as if Peter said, 'I am so mad at you that I am going to shoot your dog---in the paw.' Pure Dostoevski (*Why I Am a Catholic*, 58).
