Though most people enjoy a bit of time off this time of year, I'm looking at my calendar and not seeing anything of the sort. With all the different things I have to do in the next few weeks, I'll be putting my pen down for a while and giving the blog a rest (which means, yes, I'm also reneging on [my promise](https://twitter.com/jakebelder/status/414388773024067584) of a double-feature *[Miscellan√©es](http://blog.jakebelder.com/tag/miscellanes)* post on Saturday).

See you sometime in January.
