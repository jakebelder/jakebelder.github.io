I know I've been saturating this blog with material from or about [John Owen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Owen_%28theologian%29) lately, but I hope reading the bits and pieces posted here has been a blessing to you. There is a great deal of wisdom in the writings of Owen, and though he can be difficult to read sometimes, he points us to Christ and equips us for the journey of faith.

When I was studying earlier today, I came across some of Owen's thought on sanctification and the distinctive marks that point to our regenerated hearts. For Owen, one of the things the process of sanctification involves is the renovation or renewal of the mind. This is key. He says that the spiritual character of a person is marked by the things that person's mind naturally drift to. The clearest sign of regeneration is seen in the mind.

As a litmus test, he poses a simple question: When your mind has nothing else to think about, what do you end up thinking about? The answer to that question, Owen says, will provide a very clear indication of our spiritual condition. Naturally, it is quite convicting when you begin to ask the question of yourself.

So, what kinds of things do you think about?
