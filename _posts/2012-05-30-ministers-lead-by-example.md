<p>A story appeared in a major newspaper the other day of a minister who came under fire for some of the things he posted on Facebook. It is not particularly surprising that the media would pick up on a story like this, of course, nor was it surprising that many of the Christians I follow on Twitter started tweeting about it. What did surprise me was seeing quite a few people come to his defence.</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 401px; height: 234px;"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/shepherd-leading-sheep.jpg" /></div>
<p>I'm willing to grant that the media did its best to paint this in the worst possible light, but if some of the statements reproduced from the person's Facebook wall are accurate, then this is more than just another attempt by the media to make Christians look bad. There is a real problem here. Some argued that there was nothing wrong with a minister just showing that he is human. Fair enough. I'm a minister and I'm human, so I know that sometimes I am going to say and do things which people might not expect of a minister, and that when I do, they might garner more attention.</p>
<p>But when those things clearly contradict what the Bible says about how Christians should conduct themselves, I don't want to pass it off as 'just being human.' I want it called what it is &ndash; sin &ndash; and instead of defending me, I want people coming to me in the spirit of <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/Mt18.15-17" target="_blank">Matthew 18</a> and calling me to repentance.</p>
<p>Since we don't know all the ins and outs of the story that appeared in the news, it's best to leave it aside. But the bigger issue is one that all ministers need to think carefully about. We live much of our lives under the watchful eye of people, whether in our congregations or in the communities we live in. How we live does not go unnoticed. Many people set the bar high for church leaders, and people have every right to expect that ministers of Christ's church lead exemplary lives.</p>
<p>Though I haven't studied the ordination vows for every denomination, I would presume that this is something most every minister promises to do. The <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Book of Common Prayer</em></a> contains this question in the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-and-manner-of-making,-ordaining-and-consecrating-of-bishops,-priests-and-deacons/the-ordering-of-priests.aspx" target="_blank">form for the ordering of priests</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Will you be diligent to frame and fashion your own selves, and your families, according to the doctrine of Christ; and to make both yourselves and them, as much as in you lieth, wholesome examples and patterns to the flock of Christ?
</blockquote>
<p>To which the minister would answer, "I will apply myself thereto, the Lord being my helper." That is a big promise to make &ndash; other parts of the form mention the Bible's severe warnings to teachers and leaders in the church who would lead their parishioners astray. At one point, giving a charge, the bishop would say:</p>
<blockquote>
Have always therefore printed in your remembrance, how great a treasure is committed to your charge. For they are the sheep of Christ, which he bought with his death, and for whom he shed his blood. The Church and Congregation whom you must serve, is his spouse and his body. And if it shall happen the same Church, or any member thereof, to take any hurt or hindrance by reason of your negligence, ye know the greatness of the fault, and also the horrible punishment that will ensue...&nbsp; See that you never cease your labour, your care and diligence, until you have done all that lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all such as are or shall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeness and perfectness of age in Christ, that there be no place left among you, either for error in religion or for viciousness in life.
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes these days you come across pastors who hold to the idea that to really connect with people, you need to be slightly edgy, as a means of demonstrating that you are real or authentic, or perhaps to dispel the old notion of the minister as a holier-than-thou figure shrouded in a somewhat unapproachable and slightly angelic cloud of obscurity. I'm not suggesting that 'edginess' equates with unholiness, but I do think we walk a fine line when we start to concern ourselves with being relevant. We begin to move away from traditional notions of godliness because of the increasing alienation Christians feel from the world around them.</p>
<p>As I said a few days ago, <a href="http://jakebelder.com/sometimes-faithfulness-hurts" target="_blank">sometimes faithfulness hurts</a>, and living as a Christian often brings about an unpleasant tension. But this is a tension we need to embrace, especially as ministers. 'Edginess' may win friends in the world around us, but if it leads us to excuse any sin in the name of relevance, no matter how minor we might consider it to be, we would do well to remind ourselves that this is not at all the picture the Bible paints of a minister. Paul instructs Timothy, "Set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity... Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers" (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/1Ti4.12" target="_blank">1 Timothy 4:12</a>, <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/1Ti4.16">16</a>).</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I repeatedly fail to set the example I should. And I'll also be the first to admit that sometimes I don't even really want to try. That is the battle we all face as sinners. But that is why, as Martin Luther said, <a href="http://download.redeemer.com/pdf/learn/resources/All_of_Life_Is_Repentance-Keller.pdf" target="_blank">all of life is repentance</a>. We must constantly be making every effort to cast of sin and to become more like Christ. If we are not actively pursuing holiness, we as ministers become, quite honestly, some of the most dangerous people on the planet.</p>

It's one thing to expect a minister to be entirely without sin. That is impossible. But it's another thing to expect a minister to strive to be holy. That is a biblical command. The lives of those we shepherd depend on our godliness. And so, as the writer to the Hebrews says, "Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus" (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/Heb12.1-2">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>).
