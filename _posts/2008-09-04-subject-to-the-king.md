Initially, there is a great deal of tension created when one proclaims the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all of life. It exposes the irreconcilable divisions in our hearts and calls us to shrug off every other idolatrous allegiance we hold to, and to give our heart solely and completely to the Master. Despite the inherent difficulties that arise when trying to live faithfully out of that conviction and that confession, as we increasingly devote ourselves to Jesus Christ we discover that there is no greater joy than to be subject to the sovereignty of our King.

Why? Because,

<blockquote>
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesâ€”all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross (Col. 1:15-20).
</blockquote>

That is the God I serve. I can do no other.
