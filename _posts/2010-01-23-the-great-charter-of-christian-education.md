<p>I really like how <a href="http://www.rts.edu/faculty/StaffDetails.aspx?id=502">John Frame</a>, in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-Christian-Life-Theology-Lordship/dp/0875527965"><em>The Doctrine of the Christian Life</em></a>, calls Deuteronomy 6:6-9 the "great charter of Christian education." The verses read:</p>
<blockquote>
And these words that I command to you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, an they shall be as <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/frontlets.html">frontlets</a> between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
</blockquote>

The point here&mdash;and one that is pervasive throughout Scripture&mdash;is that the Word of God is to give shape to our whole lives and our whole being. That, too, is to be the focus of Christian education. And that is why education is something more than just the imparting of objective knowledge. <a href="http://jakebelder.blogspot.com/2009/10/what-is-education-all-about.html">Education is <em>formation</em></a>.
