With the exception of days like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, most evangelicals are wont to largely ignore the church calendar. And that means that today, of course, many will not be celebrating Ascension Day.

I have often wondered why this is the case, because Christ's ascension into heaven is no insignificant thing. Perhaps it is because Ascension Day falls on a Thursday, and it is not a holiday like Good Friday. Or maybe they do not have a deep enough appreciation for what Ascension Day means. In that case, it is worth being reminded of the profound significance of Christ's ascension. The [Heidelberg Catechism](http://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism) asks in question 49, 'How does Christ's ascension into heaven benefit us?' And it offers this answer:

<blockquote>
First, he pleads our cause<br>
in heaven<br>
in the presence of the Father.<br><br>

Second, we have our own flesh in heaven â€“<br>
a guarantee that Christ our head<br>
will take us, his members,<br>
to himself in heaven.<br><br>

Third, he sends his Spirit to us on earth<br>
as a further guarantee.<br>
By the Spirit's power<br>
we make the goal of our lives,<br>
not earthly things,<br>
but the things above where Christ is,<br>
sitting at God's right hand.
</blockquote>

Add to this the incredible promise Jesus makes in Acts 1:1-11 that the sending of the Spirit will empower us, the church, with all that we need to carry out our task to bear witness to his rule as King to the ends of the earth, and you have to wonder how we could possibly justify *not* celebrating this day. Our very life as God's people depends on the ascension.

I leave you with a relatively unknown, but entirely appropriate stanza of that great ascension hymn, '[Crown Him with Many Crowns](http://cyberhymnal.org/htm/c/r/crownhim.htm)':

<blockquote>
Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign,<br>
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain,<br>
Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing<br>
Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.
</blockquote>
