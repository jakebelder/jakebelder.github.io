<p>During our sojourn here in Grand Rapids, Michigan (which ends today), I took the opportunity to wander through <a href="http://www.bakerbookstore.com/ME2/Default.asp">Baker Book House</a>. While doing so, I noticed the book you see to your left, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-without-Religion-Really-Simple/dp/0801013992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309837332&amp;sr=8-1">God Without Religion: Can It Really Be This Simple?</a></em> I thought to myself, 'No, it's not,' and kept walking.</p>
<p>Tonight I was thinking again about the book and looked it up on Amazon. As I had been thinking of the title, I began to consider that perhaps the author himself answered the question as I did, and there was finally going to be a book at a more popular level arguing for the understanding that all of life is religion, and that humans are religious at the very core of their beings.</p>
<p>But it seems that this is not the case. I haven't read the book, but all the reviews on Amazon indicate that it is another book pushing the idea that 'religion' equals 'institutional Christianity' and/or 'salvation by works' and that real authentic Christianity is just Jesus and the Gospel. The endorsements speak of '[dumping] the religious burden' and no longer having to live 'under religious bondage.' What you get, though, is a Christianity that, in addition to being somewhat abstract and overspiritualised, is bent towards individual piety and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/56534822">puts especial emphasis on the second person of the Trinity</a>.</p>
<p>I have said it before, but will say it again: <a href="http://jakebelder.com/why-i-dont-like-the-gospel-vs-religion-distin">pitting the 'Gospel' and 'religion' against each other is an oversimplification and creates a false dichotomy</a>.</p>

Perhaps I might even be so bold as to say that there can be no Gospel without religion.
