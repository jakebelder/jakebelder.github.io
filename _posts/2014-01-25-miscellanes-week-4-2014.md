Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>19-25 January 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eh9RIz">The Ugliest Churches in the World</a></strong> – Lists like this are always subjective, and as expected, there were a few I didn't think were that bad. Nonetheless, there is some properly awful architecture here. I also find it interesting that most of these are Roman Catholic Churches.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ej4DvR">Blue Monday - the most depressing day of the year</a></strong> – It has apparently been determined that the third Monday in January is the most depressing day of the year, and so the Church of England decided to respond with some pop-psychology of its own. <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace">Archbishop Cranmer</a> has a great response to all the nonsense.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1hJOQHW">What Is Wrong With the Young, Restless and Reformed Movement? An Interpretive Essay by Paul Owen</a></strong> – This is a very interesting piece with a rather substantial analysis of some of the problems with the New Calvinist movement. Most notably, beyond a strict adherence to the 'doctrines of grace', they lack a defined and robust theology.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1duvMIy">An Evangelical, a Baptist and a Charismatic Walk Into a Bar</a></strong> – Significant numbers of Anglicans around the world would consider themselves either evangelicals or charismatics (or both). This is quite an interesting post analysing those two groups. The author suggests they have value when they are seen as renewal movements within the Anglican tradition, rather than trying to supplant it.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/LTtT2L">Familiarity and Contempt</a></strong> – Carl Trueman takes on those who insist that liturgy and repetition stifle worship and lead to nominalism. He writes, "If familiarity does breed contempt, that is not the fault of the liturgy."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1jCKIKn">Substitute these 2 evangelism questions</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager</a> says that when it comes to evangelism, we shouldn't be asking, "How much? How fast?" but rather, "What next? What now?"</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1f8WGKN">How being Anglican deepens faith</a></strong> – Over on <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">Anthony Smith's</a> blog are some interesting thoughts from <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Hunter_(bishop)">Todd Hunter</a>, a bishop in the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net">Anglican Church in North America</a>, on what he considers the strengths of Anglicanism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eJ3Q7A">Heart for God?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/glenscrivener">Glen Scrivener</a> writes, "The centre of the Christian life is not your personal relationship with God." If we don't get this, we'll never have assurance.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1eJ7w9z">The Surprising Discovery About Those Colonialist, Proselytizing Missionaries</a></strong> – This is an absolutely fascinating article on the research of sociologist Robert Woodberry, who has done some incredibly thorough research on the impact of 19th-century missionaries in the majority world. The conclusion? "'Areas where Protestant missionaries had a significant presence in the past are on average more economically developed today, with comparatively better health, lower infant mortality, lower corruption, greater literacy, higher educational attainment (especially for women), and more robust membership in nongovernmental associations.' In short: Want a blossoming democracy today? The solution is simple—if you have a time machine: Send a 19th-century missionary."
