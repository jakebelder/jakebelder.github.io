Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from <strong>09-15 June 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14roJ2K">Religious decline in the UK: Blame parents not the churches</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebishopuk">Steve Bishop</a> points to some research done a few years ago on the impact of parents on the religious convictions of young people. The findings are interesting, but in analysing something like religious decline in a culture, you can't just point to one factor as the definitive reason for that decline. That being said, we probably often underplay the role of parents in religious formation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1bmShyN">Listening to Young Atheists: Lessons for a Stronger Christianity</a></strong> – This article has been making the rounds this week, and for good reason. It is a fascinating and important insight into what factors have driven young people away from Christianity.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1bqQWXP">Privilege and the meaning of work</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/tjhoiland">Tim Høiland</a> posts a great quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whyte_%28poet%29">David Whyte</a>, helping us recognise how privileged we are to be able to do the type of work we do, and even to spend time thinking about the meaning of our work.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1bqWrG0">Why The Missional Movement Will Fail</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/Mike_Breen">Mike Breen</a> is very vocal about the need for thorough, intentional discipleship in the church, and the lack of this in the so-called 'missional movement' is why he suggests that movement will ultimately fail. It is a helpful and thought-provoking piece.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1brT9SN">Sexual Differentiation in Genesis 2?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewwmason">Matthew Mason</a>, on the blog of the <a href="http://www.saet-online.org/">Society for the Advancement of Ecclesial Theology</a>, looks at some of the implications of the creation of man and woman in Genesis 2. This is quite an interesting post, with some important conclusions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13L0Ssb">Jesus’ resurrection: extraordinary evidence required?</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">Anthony Smith</a> has a great post here asking if it is even right to suggest that the claim that Jesus rose from the dead is something 'extraordinary'. </li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/k-nH3DN-ubE">Yorkshire – when are you coming?</a></strong> – I've only lived in Yorkshire for a couple of years, but this is a place that grows on you very quickly, especially when you are surrounded by people who love their county. And to be sure, it is an absolutely beautiful place, as this brilliant video below demonstrates.</li>
