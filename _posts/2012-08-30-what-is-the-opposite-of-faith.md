<p>Last week on either Twitter or Facebook, I saw somebody quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lamott" target="_blank">Anne   Lamott</a>, who said something to the effect that the opposite of faith was   not doubt, but certainty (I've tried to find the quote again in order to link to it, but to no avail). It is probably fair to assume that many Christians still understand doubt to be the opposite of faith, but it is  becoming more common these days to hear people talk about doubt  actually being a part of faith.</p>
<p>The whole discussion about the  relationship of doubt and faith is quite an interesting one. Tim Keller, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/034097933X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=034097933X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21" target="_blank"><em>The Reason for God</em></a>, makes a great case  for the importance of doubt in shaping and strengthening our faith (see pages xvi-xvii in the introduction). Because of the negative connotations of the word 'doubt' I tend to prefer speaking of 'mystery', although I think the idea behind both words is largely the same. The point is simply  that faith entails being comfortable with the reality that there are  things we are not going to understand. God is the Creator, and we are  the creatures, and we are privy only to what he has revealed to us about  himself.</p>
<p>So I know what Lammott is trying to say, and to an extent, I  agree. A dogmatic certainty about everything, leaving no room for  questions or exploration, is not a healthy faith. It fails to properly  grasp the majesty and wonder of God. Unfortunately, many Christians grew  up in environments where that certainty was expected, and those who  wrestled with doubts were often ostracized. Christians from these backgrounds just want to acknowledge that faith must be allowed to have questions that remain unanswered.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if the pendulum is in danger of swinging too far the other way with this sort  of perspective. Is the reaction to the faith-as-certainty paradigm leading others to shy away from an element of certainty in faith altogether? There seems to be an underlying danger that we might over-emphasise the elements of mystery, focusing too much on God's transendence and turning him into a distant and unknowable  being. We have a God who has revealed himself to us, and he desires and makes possible having fellowship with him.</p>
<p>Instead of pitting certainty or doubt against faith, we should recognise that both are  important parts of faith. On the one hand, we are certain of the hope that we have in Jesus Christ, while on the other hand, we recognise that like Job or Paul in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2011:33-36&amp;version=NIV1984" target="_blank">Romans 11:33-36</a>, we are not always going to be able to answer every question. One thing I would add is that we recognise the role of doubt or mystery. We cannot allow complacency to set in. I think it is important to note that the Bible indicates that growing and maturing in faith is a movement away from doubt, not always into the realm of certainty, but certainly towards confidence. To use Job as an example again, he could still not understand why God had allowed him to suffer in the end, but he had confidence in God's sovereignty. That being said, the idea that doubt is the opposite of faith is not right.</p>
<p>All of that brings me to the initial question: what is the opposite of faith? Instead of certainty or doubt, I think a better answer is unbelief. Too much emphasis on either certainty or doubt is perhaps an imbalance of faith, but neither consciously does away with faith. <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_deliver.cfm#QandA%2021" target="_blank">The Heidelberg Catechism says that true faith</a> is, in part, 'a knowledge and conviction that everything God reveals in his Word is true.' It follows, then, that the opposite of that knowledge and conviction can only be a willing rejection of it. An imbalance of certainty or doubt does not deny truth itself, but is instead a question of the extent to which a person believers they can understand what they believe to be true.</p>

Whether or not someone has faith is not determined by asking the question, 'How much of this can I understand?' Instead, the fundamental question is, 'Do I believe this to be true, whether or not I can understand it?' There is much more that can be said on this, but I think the answer to that question illustrates that it is ultimately faith and unbelief which stand in opposition.
