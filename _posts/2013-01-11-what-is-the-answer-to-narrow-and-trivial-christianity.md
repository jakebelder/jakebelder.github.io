<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_L._Sayers" target="_blank">Dorothy Sayers</a> once asked, &ldquo;How can any one remain interested in a religion which seems to have no concern with nine-tenths of his life?&rdquo; In a similar vein, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott" target="_blank">John Stott</a> has said, "One of the major reasons people reject the Gospel today is not because they perceive it to be false but because they perceive it to be trivial."</p>
<p>What is to be done to address the problem of a narrow and trivial Christianity? While there are many different answers to this question, I would suggest that one of the most important things we can do is to recover a robust doctrine of creation.</p>
<p>Christians rightly acknowledge that because God is the Creator of all things, we owe him all our worship and must serve him in all that we do. Yet many Christians unconsciously embody a Christianity plagued by a dichotomy between sacred and secular, demarcating some areas of life as 'neutral' or 'irrelevant', thereby failing to honour God's sovereign rule over all despite confessing the opposite. In many cases, this can be traced to a failure to appropriate a holistic understanding of creation. When we give due attention to the doctrine of creation, we recognise that the Lord who created and gives shape and structure to the whole of our creaturely existence is also the one who defines for us what it looks like to serve him in every area of life. Without this understanding, Christianity quickly becomes individualistic and pietistic, and much of our lives end up being informed by the norms and values of our culture.</p>

<p>What can be done to renew the focus on creation and revive a holistic Christianity? We must start with the basis &ndash; the gospel. We need a gospel that begins with creation, as <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/a-tim-keller-definition-of-the-gospel" target="_blank">I suggested in my last post</a>. Only a gospel <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html" target="_blank">that addresses the redemption of the whole of creation</a> can provide the basis for whole-life transformation. From there, we can begin to explore a fuller understanding of the implications of the doctrine of creation, which is something I have addressed frequently in previous posts</a> on this blog. The reality is that our understanding of creation informs so much of our theology and practice.</p>

I would encourage you to take the time to do some serious thinking and reading on the doctrine of creation. The single best place to start is with <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm" target="_blank">Al Wolters'</a> book, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Creation-Regained-Albert-Wolters/9780802829696" target="_blank"><em>Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformation Worldview</em></a>. When you read his book, you will be blown away by the implications of a Christianity that is built on a thorough understanding of the doctrine of creation, and in addition to helping you deepen your own understanding of the lordship of Christ, it will equip you to disciple others and help them think about what it looks like to serve Christ in <em>all</em> of life.
