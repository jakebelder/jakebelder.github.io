I’ve started to slowly make my way through a collection of writings from the Anglican tradition, called *[Love’s Redeeming Work: The Anglican Quest for Holiness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0191070580/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0191070580&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. I read this portion from [Hugh Latimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Latimer) comparing the work of a preacher with that of a ploughman, and I found it quite helpful:

<blockquote>
Well may the preacher and the ploughman be likened together: first, for their labour of all seasons of the year; for there is no time of the year in which the ploughman hath not some special work to do: as in my country in Leicestershire, the ploughman hath a time to set forth, and to assay his plough, and other times for other necessary works to be done. And then they also may be likened together for the diversity of works and variety of offices that they have to do. For as the ploughman first setteth forth his plough, and then tilleth his land, and breaketh it in furrows, and sometimes ridgeth it up again; and at another time harroweth it and clotteth it, and sometime dungeth it and hedgeth it, diggeth it and weedeth it, purgeth and maketh it clean: so the prelate, the preacher, hath many diverse offices to do. He hath first a busy work to bring his parishioners to a right faith, as Paul calleth it, and not a swerving faith; but to a faith that embraceth Christ, and trusteth to his merits; a lively faith, a justifying faith; a faith that maketh a man righteous, without respect of works: as ye have it very well declared and set forth in the Homily, [‘<a href="http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/doctrine/homilies/iss_doctrine_homilies_04.asp">Of a true and lively faith</a>’]. He hath then a busy work, I say, to bring his flock to a right faith, and then to confirm then in the same faith: now casting them down with the law, and with threatenings of God for sin; now ridging them up again with the gospel, and with the promises of God’s favour: now weeding them, by telling them their faults, and making them forsake sin; now clotting them, by breaking their stony hearts, and by making them supplehearted, and making them to have hearts of flesh.
</blockquote>

Hence the call to proclaim the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27). Preaching is for every person in every season of life.
