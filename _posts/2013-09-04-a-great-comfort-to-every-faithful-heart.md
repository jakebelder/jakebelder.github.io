There are only a few brief excerpts from [Hugh Latimer's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Latimer) writings in the collection of writings from the Anglican tradition, *[Love's Redeeming Work: The Anglican Quest for Holiness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0191070580/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0191070580&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, but this one, on the Lord's Prayer, also struck me:

<blockquote>
But one word is left, which we must needs consider; <em>Noster</em>, ‘our.’ He saith not ‘my,’ but ‘our.’ Wherefore saith he ‘our?’ This word ‘our’ teacheth us to consider that the Father of heaven is a common Father; as well my neighbour’s Father as mine; as well the poor man’s Father as the rich: so that he is not a peculiar Father, but a Father to the whole church and congregation, to all the faithful. Be they never so poor, so vile, so foul and despised, yet he is their Father as well as mine: and therefore I should not despise them, but consider that God is their Father as well as mine. Here may we perceive what communion is between us; so that when I pray, I pray not for myself alone, but for all the rest: again, when they pray, they pray not for themselves only, but for me: for Christ hath so framed this prayer, that I must needs include my neighbour in it. Therefore all those which pray this prayer, they pray as well for me as for themselves; which is a great comfort to every faithful heart, when he considereth that all the church prayeth for him.
</blockquote>

A great comfort, indeed.
