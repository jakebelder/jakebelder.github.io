<p><a href="http://unashamedworkman.wordpress.com/">Colin Adams</a> posts this paragraph from Christopher Ash's, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Priority-Preaching-Mentor-Commentary/dp/184550464X"><em>The Priority of Preaching</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I do not think this means that every preacher has to become a great  cultural expert. It can be daunting to hear a speaker imply that unless  we all become equipped to give deep and perceptive analyses of  everything from the fashion industry to climate change, we cannot  preach. We cannot each become experts in every aspect of our culture and  contemporary issues. What we can and must do is love the people we  serve and the people we seek to reach. And if we love people we will  listen to them and begin to understand them. And if we do that  thoughtfully we are bound to get an insight into culture (56).
</blockquote>
<p>He makes a good point, but I am not sure I am in full agreement with him. Questions surrounding the church and culture are always big questions, and I wonder if Ash is a little dismissive of the issue. Then again, this is one short paragraph in what is probably a much longer chapter, and it would be good to read this in the broader context.</p>

What do you think?
