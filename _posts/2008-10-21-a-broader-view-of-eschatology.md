<p>Former <a href="http://www.rts.edu/site/about/campuses/orlando/index.aspx">RTS Orlando</a> student, former employee at <a href="http://www.brightlightbooks.com/">my current favorite bookstore</a>, and current adjunct professor of theology at the New York City campus of <a href="http://www.nyackcollege.edu/">Nyack College</a>, <a href="http://apologet.wordpress.com/">Joseph Torres</a>, discusses what he calls <a href="http://apolojet.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/a-wider-vision-of-eschatology/">a wider vision of eschatology in his most recent post</a>. In evangelical circles, it is common to link the discussion of eschatology with what events will transpire at the end of history&mdash;the rapture, the tribulation, the thousand-year reign, and so on. But, Joseph suggests broadening our discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Protology</em> is the study of &ldquo;first things,&rdquo; and explores what I call seedbed for a multiplicity of themes are developed and expanded throughout the rest of the story told in the Bible. Just a few of these would include <em>the seed of the woman, the people of God, human dominion over the earth, sin, judgment, and the Word of God</em>, to name a few. Eschatology, in the expanded definition, is the study of where these developing themes &ldquo;end up.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the final goal of these themes? That&rsquo;s what eschatology studies. It&rsquo;s more than merely about the debates over the timing of the return of Christ (though, of course, it&rsquo;s not less than these debates).
</blockquote>

<p>A helpful corrective, I think. Broadening our perspective in this way, Joseph argues, helps to cultivate a biblically-informed philosophy of history and plays a significant role in shaping our worldview.</p>

What do you think? How will our perspective change if we consider where history is going as opposed to what happens when history ends?
