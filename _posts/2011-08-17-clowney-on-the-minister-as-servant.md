A minister, by nature of the office, is in a position of power. Far too often, that power is abused and the minister no longer approaches the calling with humility. [Edmund Clowney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Clowney), former professor at Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, offers these helpful words in his book, *[Called to the Ministry](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0875521444/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0875521444)*:

<blockquote>
A minister is a servant; Christ is the one Lord, who must rule until all his enemies are put under his feet (1 Cor 15:25, Col. 3:1). No one is called to lord it over the flock of Christ (1 Pet. 5:3); no throne is set in the church but the one at God's right hand.
</blockquote>

That last line is absolutely key.
