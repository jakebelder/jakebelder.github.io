Christians are well acquainted with the titles 'Son of Man' and 'Son of God' being applied to Jesus, but [Oliver O'Donovan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_O%27Donovan), in his book, *[On the Thirty-Nine Articles: Conversations with Tudor Christianity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HITR40/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B005HITR40&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, makes an interesting observation on how these Christological titles are no longer used as they originally were:

<blockquote>
We need only think, for example, of how the title 'Son of Man' lost its apocalyptic, eschatological significance, central to its use in the recorded teaching of Jesus, and was misunderstood as though it represented one half of the two-natures doctrine; and of how the title 'Son of God' was taken to represent the other half, losing all echoes of Messianic kingship from which it sprang.
</blockquote>

What can be done to begin to reclaim their proper usage?
