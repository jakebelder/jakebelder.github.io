<p>I have been a fan of <a href="http://www.saet-online.org/">The Society for the Advancement of Ecclesial Theology</a> ever since I first heard of them. Their mission, as stated on their website, is 'to [assist] pastor-theologians in producing biblical and theological scholarship for the ecclesial renewal of theology and the theological renewal of the church.' To that end, 'armed with the conviction that pastors can &ndash; indeed must &ndash; once again serve as the church&rsquo;s most important theologians, it is the aim of the SAET to provide a context of theological engagement for those pastors who desire to make ongoing contributions to the wider theological/scholarly community for the renewal of orthodox theology, for the renewal of the church.'</p>
<p>I've only recently discovered that they have a short introductory video talking about what they do, which you can watch below:</p>

<p>In a time when many Christians are suspicious of theology or treat it as something secondary or even non-essential ('All that's important is that we love Jesus!'), it is great to see that there are organisations like this thoroughly committed to the idea that <a href="http://jakebelder.com/theology-is-for-the-church">theology is for the church</a>&nbsp;and coming up with practical ways to turn that idea into reality. Perhaps their plans for the future include setting up a fellowship here in the UK?</p>
