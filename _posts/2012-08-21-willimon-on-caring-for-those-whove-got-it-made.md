<p>When people think of pastoral care, they are often inclined to think about visiting those in hospital, or counselling those going through a rough spot in their marriage, or helping others through the grieving process. But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Willimon" target="_blank">William Willimon</a>, again in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0687045320/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0687045320" target="_blank"><em>Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry</em></a>, suggests that pastoral care ought to have a broader scope than that. He observes that we also need to be ready to counsel those who seem to have it made:</p>
<blockquote>
The pastor not only counsels and controls the troubled, but also confronts the complacent. I recall hearing the great preacher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arthur_Buttrick" target="_blank">George Buttrick</a> say that almost any pastor can visit a parishioner who has just received news that she has a terminal illness, or has just lost his job, or whose child has just flunked out of school. People in such distress are happy to haer from anyone, even their preacher, said Buttrick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It takes a very special pastor to visit that person who has just been promoted at the bank, or the person whose child has just been accepted at Harvard University, contended Buttrick. The skilful pastor knows that spiritual peril lies in what the world considers good news, or health, or success. Thus pastoral counsel is more than merely tending the wounded, lifting up the broken-hearted. It is also a matter of teaching, guiding, and admonishing the well and the well fixed, the satisfied and the content. The Christian faith is both comfort for the afflicted and an affliction to the comfortable, and it is the pastor's vocation to be one of the church's agents of that good news.
</blockquote>
<p>There is a common assumption that people going through trials in life are most susceptible to losing their faith, but in reality, trials often work to bring believers closer to God. Willimon rightly suggests that it is actually those who seem to find 'success' at every turn whose faith is in the greatest danger. And it takes guts to walk into a parishioner's house and say, 'Congratulations on the new job. But I'm concerned about your faith.'</p>

However, pastors are called to lead their congregations in faithfulness to the Lord Jesus no matter what their circumstances, and sometimes this will mean challenging those who've got it made.
