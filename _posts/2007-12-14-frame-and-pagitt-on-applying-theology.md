When I read John Frame's book, *Salvation Belongs to the Lord*, for the first time back in March, I had quoted parts of his conclusion on this blog. Having just read it again in finishing up a class, I'm reminded of his words. He said,

<blockquote>
Theology is the application of the Word to all areas of life. God hasn't given us His precious Word so that we should just carry it around in our heads. And he certainly hasn't given it to us so to that we can boast to others of how much we know and look down on them because they haven't had the opportunity God has given us...<br><br>

God wants you to know his word...know it so well that it is at the tip of your tongue, so that you can use it to comfort or challenge somebody in need. This is the Great Commission, of course, and that is what we are about. That is why we are on earth...<br><br>

God wants his Word written on your heart. That is the heart of the new covenant in Jeremiah 31, that God will write his Word not on tables of stone but on the fleshy tables of our hearts. That means that the Word of God is so intimately fixed in our inmost being that God's desires are our desires, that his commands are our wishes, that we deeply want to be what he wants us to be. Don't be satisfied, then, with what seems to be an adequate concept of biblical doctrine. Keep asking how that doctrine should change you. Ask what sins of your heart God is rebuking, what righteous choices he wants you to embrace. Don't have the attitude of wanting to defend the status quo in your life or in the church. God gave us the Bible to bring changes in us, and he isn't finished doing that yet (341-342).
</blockquote>

Frame's theology is based on the authority of Scripture, and his conclusions are extensions of that foundation. In contrast to that, I had to interact with a chapter authored by Emergent leader Doug Pagitt in the edited collection, *Listening to the Beliefs of Emerging Churches*. His perspective on theology was completely different. Initially he rejected the authority of Scripture as a basis for theology:

<blockquote>
Do we not put the emphasis on the wrong place when we begin with focusing on Scripture, especially in this way which seems to put the impetus on Scripture as the revealer?...Many of us who hold the Bible in high regard have the unfortunate habit or trying to theologize, or moralize, the Bible to serve our context. This is quite often seen in the tendency to precede a quote from the Bible by saying, ‘The Bible says…’ rather than acknowledging where it is from, an to whom it was intended. What I find objectionable about this is that it removes the context and places authority in the fact that the statement is in the Bible rather than considering the faith and lives of the people involved (113, 125).
</blockquote>

For Pagitt, that meant a rejection of doing theology in the way that Frame does. The follow-through for this on how to apply theology takes on a different tone with Pagitt.

<blockquote>
There are far too many people inside Christian faith who feel the need to ‘give a nod’ to the theology of their church or tribe, but it really has nothing to do with their lives…because theology has so often been seen as permanent inarguable statements of truth that could never change ‘because God never changes,’ it has also lost its function to be a profession of faith from the community that is bound by it. In my view, this kind of disconnected theology is not useful nor should it be encouraged (123).
</blockquote>

Frame makes it plain that this type of theology is not at all meaningless, but instead, when properly done, can enrich our communion with God. God's Word is a revelation of himself, so it only makes sense that knowing it better means we would know him better. These are challenging and helpful words in a culture whose theological climate would resonate much more deeply with Pagitt than Frame.

What Frame reminds us of is that what we learn is not supposed to remain in our minds, but is supposed to change us, make us grow, stretch us, empower us, and guide us. As Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." We need to let the Word of God dwell in our hearts. Don't just love it, live it. We certainly don't need to concede to anything less.

What do you think?
