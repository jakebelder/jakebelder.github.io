In some ways, the title of this post is a bit of a misnomer, because it’s just the continuation of an existing blog. If you followed me while I was blogging on Posterous, you know that I first thought about switching to Wordpress, but I just wasn't happy with that idea. Thankfully, I found [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am), which is a really cool Dropbox-based host. Yes, that means this blog is coming to you directly from my [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com). The best thing about this? My blog is *always* backed up.

You will notice that the url of this blog has changed, and that just has to do with how Scriptogram handles custom domains. [jakebelder.com](http://www.jakebelder.com) still exists, but now acts as a sort of 'start page' with links to this blog and things like my Twitter and Facebook profiles.

I am working on importing all the posts from my Posterous blog, which is a bit of work, but soon everything will be available at this site. Unfortunately, the links for individual posts have all changed, and so any links within my posts linking to other posts will be broken for now, as well as any links from outside sites. I’m not settled on the template or design yet, so expect some changes in appearance too.  I've given up any hope of importing comments from the Posterous blog, since their API seems to be broken. So, if you commented on anything on the old blog, I'm sorry.

But it's good to have everything up and running again. I'm off on holiday in a few days, though, so don't expect much new posting in the next couple of weeks yet.
