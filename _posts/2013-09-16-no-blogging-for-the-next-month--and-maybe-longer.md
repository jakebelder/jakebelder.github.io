For reasons [alluded to in a previous post](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/why-we-are-adopting-a-personal-post), I won't be blogging at all for at least the next month. However, I will continue to use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/jakebelder), so you can follow me there if you'd like.

The title of this post suggests that a blogging hiatus may be longer, and that is because of some changes made by [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am), the platform I use to host this blog. Last night I found out that they no longer support HTML formatting in posts, and since most of my posts have some HTML, nothing looks right any more (although, this morning it appears that some of the formatting is working again). At any rate, I have two choices: move the blog – *[again](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/welcome-to-the-new-blog)*, or give up blogging altogether.

Honestly, at this point, I'm leaning towards the latter option. But I won't make any hasty decisions, and will see how things go in a month.

**Update:** *As you can probably tell, Scriptogram has decided to support HTML again, so I think at this point you can largely ignore the last two paragraphs of this post.*
