<p><em>(Our staff team meets for devotions and prayer each morning from Monday-Thursday, and this week I'm leading those devotions. I'm reflecting on some of the themes of Advent, and I thought I would share those reflections here.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Scripture Readings:</strong> <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Zep3.14-20">Zephaniah 3:14-20</a>, <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Php4.4-9">Philippians 4:4-9</a></p>
<p>In the past couple of days, we've seen that Advent is <a href="http://jakebelder.com/advent-he-will-come">a time to look forward</a>, and <a href="http://jakebelder.com/advent-refine-us-lord">a time to prepare our hearts</a> for Christ's coming. Today we are taking a moment to see that Advent is also a time of joy.</p>
<p>During this season, as we reflect on God's faithfulness to his covenant promises, we recognise that we have so many reasons to be joyful. The prophecy we read from Zephaniah is just overflowing with joy as the prophet announces all the blessings that the Lord will pour out on his people. He has taken away their punishment and he dwells with his people (3:15). The Lord is mighty to save, and he takes great delight in his people (3:17). He gathers those who have been scattered, brings them home, and gives them honour and praise among all the peoples of the earth (3:19-20).</p>
<p>As with so many of the prophecies, this has both a past and future fulfilment. And we rejoice in both, knowing that some of these promises have already been fulfilled in Christ's first coming, and because we know with certainty that when he returns, these promises will all find their ultimate fulfilment.</p>
<p>In this time, as we wait for Christ's second coming, how do we express our joy? John the Baptist, in <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Lk3.8">Luke 3:8</a>, called the people to prepare for the coming of the Messiah by "producing fruit in keeping with repentance." When we remember the work of redemption that God has done through Jesus, we respond with gratitude by submitting ourselves to him. Our joy is expressed by living in obedience to Christ.</p>
<p>In Philippians 4:4, Paul writes, "Rejoice in the Lord always." It is important to note that this is a command. Joy is a wilful action on our part. Our joy begins when we believe the good news of the Gospel and lay hold of what God has done through Jesus. That joy then finds further expression as we follow the commands which Paul mentions here &ndash; not being anxious about anything, seeking after that which is true, noble, right, and so on. We put into practice the way of living that God has designed for his people, and we receive his peace.</p>

The more we submit our lives to our Lord Jesus, the fuller our joy becomes. So, we pray that as we look forward to his return, that we will remember all the blessings he has given us and rejoice in his goodness to us. We anticipate the fulfilment of all of his covenant promises. And we pray that our joy may increase as we live under his rule, that on the day when Christ returns, "when he gathers us and brings us home," as Zephaniah said, he will find us full of joy as we gaze upon his face and stand before his glorious throne.
