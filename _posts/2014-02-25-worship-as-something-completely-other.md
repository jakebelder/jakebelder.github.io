'As we leave the church after the Sunday Eucharist we enter again into time.' So begins the third chapter of [Alexander Schmemann's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Schmemann) book, *[For the Life of the World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0913836087/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0913836087&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*. I quote that, not because I want to discuss Schmemann's view of time – although that in itself is fascinating – but because it struck me that for Schmemann (and the Orthodox), worship is something so completely different, so completely 'other', that they can speak of *entering back into time* when they leave the church where they have gathered.

Something distinct and unique happens when Christians come together for worship, says Schmemann, because there, gathered together, they constitute a new community with a new life as they encounter the risen and ascended Christ. But, he adds, the sense of that reality is something we have largely lost in our churches as we've sought to accommodate those outside of the church.

<blockquote>
The liturgy begins then as a real separation from the world. In our attempt to make Christianity appeal to the man on the street, we have often minimized, or even completely forgotten, this necessary separation. We always want to make Christianity 'understandable' and 'acceptable' to this mythical 'modern' man on the street. And we forget that the Christ of whom we speak is 'not of this world' (27).
</blockquote>

This, he continues, hinders our mission in and to the world. If we are going to be faithful witnesses of Christ and his Kingdom, we need to, in our worship, inhabit and be transformed by the reality of *that* world.

<blockquote>
The early Christians realized that in order to become the temple of the Holy Spirit they must <em>ascend to heaven</em> where Christ has ascended. They realized also that this ascension was the very condition of their mission in the world. For there – in heaven – they were immersed in the new life of the Kingdom; and when, after this 'liturgy of ascension,' they returned into the world, their faces reflected the light, the 'joy and peace' of that Kingdom and they were truly its witnesses. They brought no programs and no theories; but wherever they went, life was transfigured, things impossible were made possible. They were witnesses, and when they were asked, 'Whence shines this light, where is the source of this power?' they knew what to answer and where to lead men. In church today, we so often find we meet only the same old world, not Christ and His Kingdom. We do not realize that we never get anywhere because we never leave any place behind us (28).
</blockquote>

In the circles I find myself in, I often hear people say that our worship here on earth is to be a reflection and a foretaste of that vision of God's people gathered round his throne in Revelation 7:9-17. If that is true, then it should also be true that when we gather for worship, we are aware that this gathering itself and what we do when we are gathered is indeed something completely 'other'. If Schmemann is right that this encounter with a greater reality through Word and Sacrament is what animates and transforms and equips us for our mission in this world, then we ought to examine our worship in order to ensure that we are not being shaped by the reality of *this* world.

What's more, this dumbing down of worship is not only detrimental to us, it hinders those outside of the church from discovering the fullness of the reality that comes about through the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, and that we are called to live in through our incorporation into him. For some reason, we seem to have this fear that if people who are not Christians join us on Sunday and find themselves in the middle of something completely different from the reality they know, that they will be turned away. Could it not be that, though, that [encountering a whole other reality](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/who-is-worship-for), getting a taste of a whole new world, is what might actually draw them in to life in the Kingdom? Perhaps it's worth noting here that the challenge of unaccommodated worship is one of the reasons [Orthodox churches attract men in greater numbers](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/getting-men-into-church).

When you move to a new country, you don't completely understand the culture and language right away. It is a whole new world. Likewise, Christ has ushered in a new Kingdom and calls us to enter a new world. This is a reality that is very different from the one we know apart from Christ. Let's stop assuming that worship must be something simple and immediately understandable to everyone, and recapture the sense of 'otherness' that is only fitting as we gather before the throne of the [holy and awesome God](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/schmemann-on-gods-holiness), and as we encounter the Christ who alone can bring us into this new world.
