Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>15-21 June 2014</strong>.

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1qnIYdM">The Voices of the Father and the Son</a></strong> – 'Prosopological exegesis' is one mouthful of a term, but it is a very interesting concept focused on discerning the voices of God the Father and God the Son in the Old Testament. <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> helpfully discusses it in this post.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1lBQYGr">Reading: The Struggle</a></strong> – Some thoughts on the challenges of reading in this age of distraction: "Every moment of serious reading has to be fought for, planned for... When we read there are more breaks, ever more frequent stops and restarts, more input from elsewhere, fewer refuges where the mind can settle. It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually <em>inclined</em> to interruption. Hence more and more energy is required to stay in contact with a book, particularly something long and complex."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Ug1JTm">Theses on the Revelation of the Trinity</a></strong> – Here is another helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> on the revelation of the Trinity in Scripture. His statements here are based on the assertion that "the mode of revelation of the Trinity has structural implications for the right presentation of the doctrine."</li>
