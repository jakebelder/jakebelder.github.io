Anthony makes what I think is a profoundly important point that needs to be taken seriously if we are to think about what it looks like to be faithful in our Western context. Yet amongst the myriad of books and articles and whatever else claiming to have the answer to why the church in the West is declining and increasingly being marginalised, this point is seemingly never made. Liberal Christians often contend that the church’s decline is a result of having not kept up with the values of our culture and society, and thus being perceived as completely irrelevant and out of touch. Conservative Christians often contend that the church’s decline is a result of the influence of liberal Christianity and the watering down of the gospel.

To some degree or another both of these factors could be taken into account, but neither is sufficient to answer the question altogether. The problem with these conclusions is that they only look at *our* action in history. They fail to point to the action of *God* in directing the course of history.

I have always been fascinated by Acts 16:7-8, which has sometimes been called [the most pivotal event in Western history](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/the-most-pivotal-event-in-western-history), when the Spirit of Jesus prevented Paul, Silas, and Timothy from going into Bythnia on their missionary journey and prompted them to go Macedonia instead. One of the things that is striking about Luke's narrative here is that it solely focuses on the action of God in directing history in relation to the spread of the gospel and the growth of the church. Nothing is said about Paul, Silas, and Timothy's response to this prompting, nor about the reasons God sent them where he did. And Anthony’s question is simply this: If God has directed that the gospel would spread to certain places and not others before, why could he not do the same today?

My point is not that we should not always be on the move, going where the church is growing the most. Paul, Silas, and Timothy had a unique call, and other examples from the book of Acts show Christians labouring faithfully where they are. Nor is my point that we should not consider any other factors in trying to come to grips with what has happened in the West. What we need to understand most of all, though, in this context where the church is not growing in the ways it is in other parts of the world, is that we will only remain faithful and avoid discouragement if we simply remember that God is in control. If you don’t have confidence that God is directing the course of history and that he is at work in the world to build his church, you will ultimately think that it all depends on you. And when you then find yourself in a 'time of small things', as one of my colleagues likes to say, your response will be to either give up on the means God has given us to do the work he has called us to, or give up entirely because you are so discouraged.

Ministry is always hard work, and there are always challenges. In many of those parts of the world where the church is flourishing, Christians face significant opposition and persecution. Our challenge is, amongst other things, significant apathy. It's helpful for us to remember Paul's instructions to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2: 'Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season.' Paul goes on to tell Timothy that he will find himself in a time that sounds very similar to our own. And what is Timothy to do then? He is just to press on faithfully with the work he has been entrusted with.

We certainly ought to pray that the church will again grow and flourish here in the West. But in the end, that is not up to us. Right now we are simply called to be faithful, whatever the situation. And no matter what it looks like around us, there are many other places in the world that remind us we can be confident in Jesus' promise: 'I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it' (Matthew 16:18). God is always at work.
