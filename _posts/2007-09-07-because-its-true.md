One of the things I'm appreciating so much about the professors at RTS is their commitment to the Bible, to upholding it as the Word of God in all its fullness. And it's not at all in the legalistic sense---what some call bibliolatry---but rather it's reverent, respectful, and obedient submissiveness to the authority of God's written Word. It's infecting.

But as much as they love their respective disciplines---be it biblical studies, systematic theology, or whatever else---they are ready to strip all those layers away and see the greater story; the beautiful, wonderful story of redemption, of God working His purposes throughout history, and seeing our place in that story. They love that story, and love to tell that story. A professor mentioned this oft-quoted line from Stanley Hauerwas the other day:

<blockquote>
...all we have left is a story to tell. But it's the best damn story ever told, because it's true.
</blockquote>

And that is what we live for.
