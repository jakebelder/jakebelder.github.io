<p>Byron Borger has followed up his <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/booknotes/living_at_the_crossroads_in_th/">last post</a> (which I mentioned <a href="http://jakebelder.com/booknotes-studying-how-we-see">here</a>) with <a href="http://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/reviews/living_at_the_crossroads_an_in/">another post</a> today building on what he previously said.  I highly recommend you read his latest post as well, in which he speaks extensively and encouragingly of <a href="http://www.biblicaltheology.ca/authors/">Michael Goheen and Craig Bartholomew's</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.biblicaltheology.ca/living-at-the-crossroads/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Living at the Crossroads: An Introduction to Christian Worldview</span></a>.  I have yet to read it myself, but having studied under Goheen I have already been deeply impacted by many of the ideas in this book.  Borger, in the middle of the post, again speaks of why worldview study is so important.</p>

<blockquote>
[Worldview study] is not just for eggheads or intellectuals.  We all long for coherence and integrated lives.  We are not content with a narrow faith and the more attentive we are to the Bible, the more we come away informed by this comprehensive claim that Christ makes over all of life.  Such coherence and integrity leads to joy.  It is as simple as that: life lived out of a distinctively and intentional Christian worldview is more complicated (everything matters) and demanding (we cannot conform to the ways of the world, not in voting, or shopping, in sexual matters or business matters or recreational matters.)  Yet, in that cost of discipleship comes joy.  I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Warren">Rick Warren's</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purpose_Driven_Life"><span style="font-style: italic;">Purpose Driven Life</span></a> touched something deep about all this, and it is revealing just how popular that was a few years back. In this postmodern world, we sense things unravelling, and we yearn for meaning, purpose, direction.  A comprehensive framework for understanding things makes for a purposeful life.  It makes for a joyful life.  It makes for a righteous life.

Borger's last two posts are well worth your time, and his recommendations are well worth the space on your bookshelves.
