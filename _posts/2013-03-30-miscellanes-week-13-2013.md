<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/the-case-for-getting-married-young/274293/" target="_blank"><strong>The Case for Getting Married Young</strong></a> - I've been a proponent of the idea of getting married young for some time, and this article sums up some of the reasons why. Among other things, the author observes, "Marriage actually works best as a formative institution, not an institution you enter once you think you're fully formed... The greatest gift of marriage...is the formation that occurs through the give and take of living in lifelong communion with another." </li>
<li><a href="http://www.makotofujimura.com/writings/refractions-38-michelangelos-sistine-chapel-raphael-and-a-yellow-polar-bear/" target="_blank"><strong>Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, Raphael and a Yellow Polar Bear</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/iamfujimura" target="_blank">Makoto Fujimura</a> makes some very interesting observations on what the artwork on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel actually communicates. Far from drawing us up into the worship of Christ, he writes, it is actually one of the most awkward worship spaces one will ever enter.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2013/03/23/3722235.htm" target="_blank"><strong>What now for the Archbishop of Canterbury? Reflections on Rowan Williams and Justin Welby</strong></a> - Collected here are a number of different opinion pieces reflecting on the ministries of the two most recent Archbishops of Canterbury. All agree that there is quite a marked difference between Williams and Welby.</li>
