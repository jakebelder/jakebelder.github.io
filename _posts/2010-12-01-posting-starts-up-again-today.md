The month of November has gone by very quickly, and so today I resume posting here on the blog. The month off was good, and I enjoyed the little bit of extra time afforded me by letting the blog rest for a while. However, there wasn't as much extra time as I had hoped forâ€”my reprieve from blogging seemed to coincide with an increase in the number of hours I worked this month.

As it stands, the work load shows no signs of slowing (especially with the holidays fast approaching), and so while I still intend to start writing again, I cannot promise that it will be with the same sort of regularity I was able to maintain before. There are several posts in line waiting to be written or completed, but once those are finished, things may be a little more sporadic around here.

For now, it's good to be back, and I look forward to continued conversations with those of you who are kind enough to follow the blog.
