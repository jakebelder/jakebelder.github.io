<p>A few weeks ago, I celebrated my thirtieth birthday. Turning thirty  is a big deal for many people, and it is an occasion often accompanied by big  parties and celebrations. To be sure, turning thirty is something of a milestone, but it was thirty years ago today that something far  more significant happened in my life.</p>
<p>On this day in 1983, my parents (pictured here, holding me in the traditional white baptism gown) took me in their arms, approached  the baptismal font at Second Christian Reformed Church in Toronto (now <a href="http://www.reformedtoronto.org/" target="_blank">Covenant Reformed Church</a>), and presented  me before the congregation to be baptised and welcomed into the covenant  community. <a href="http://www.crcna.org/resources/church-resources/liturgical-forms-resources/baptism-children/service-baptism-1976" target="_blank">Using this form</a>, the minister briefly instructed the  congregation on the meaning and importance of baptism, and then my parents made vows  confessing their belief in the church's faith and their promise to  instruct me in that faith. The minister then applied the water to my  head and baptised me into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy  Spirit.</p>
<p>Though I remember nothing of this day, I count it as one of the most  significant days in my life. This is not because I believe my baptism  saved me or regenerated me, but because it was on this day that the seal of my membership  in God's covenant family was applied to me. My baptism signified that, from this point  forward, I belonged to Christ, and that by faith I could lay claim to  all the benefits of his death and resurrection. I was brought into  fellowship with him as well as with his church, where I had the privilege of sitting  under the ministry of Word and sacrament and partaking in the life of  God's people. After a time, I came to publicly affirm the promises made  to me in my baptism and to claim for myself the blessings of my union  with Christ. I confessed my belief in the redeeming work of Christ to  cleanse me from my sin and to give me new life, and I vowed to live  faithfully before him and to honour him as my Lord and King.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I know I was enabled to do this only by the power of the indwelling  Holy Spirit, but I also know that God used my  parents in particular to instill the faith of the church in me. They  took the vows they made at my baptism very seriously, and faithfully  carried out their responsibilities as covenant parents. Without the  example of their faith and their thorough, loving instruction, I would  not be where I am today. I am eternally grateful to God for their faithfulness.</p>
<p>The fact that I am a child of the covenant and am united to Christ is the single most important thing that defines who I am. I cannot separate my identity from my baptism. This is why we are so often urged to remember that we have been baptised. The <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/anonymous/westminster2.i.vii.html" target="_blank">Westminster Larger Catechism, Q&A 167</a>, uses the somewhat strange language  of 'improving our baptism', by which it means that we should continually  remind ourselves of what our baptism signifies in order that we might be encouraged to  flee from sin and grow in grace. The reformer, John Calvin, makes the same point in <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes/Page_2514.html" target="_blank">IV.xv.3 of the <em>Institutes</em></a>. As we remember the washing with water,  we remember that we have been forgiven and cleansed through the blood of  Christ, and that our old selves were buried with him in baptism so that  we could be raised to new life with him (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2:11-13&version=NIV" target="_blank">Col. 2:12</a>). The knowledge that we now share in the life of the risen Christ spurs us on to make  every effort to grow in holiness and righteousness, so that we  might conform ourselves more and more to the one with whom we are united in  baptism.</p>
<p>Some people look at baptism as merely a tradition or a rite  of passage, but when I remember what happened to me thirty years ago  today, I rejoice in knowing that I can confidently say with the  <a href="http://www.heidelberg-catechism.com/en/lords-days/1.html" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a>, 'I am not my own, but belong – body and soul,  in life and in death – to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ.'</p>

And there is nothing in this world I am more thankful for than this.
