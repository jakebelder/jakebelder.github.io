Richard John Neuhaus, from *[Catholic Matters: Confusion, Controversy, and the Splendor of Truth](http://www.amazon.com/Catholic-Matters-Confusion-Controversy-Splendor/dp/B000MKYKCC/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201010038&sr=8-1)*:

<blockquote>
Americans are notorious church-hoppers. Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal, Baptist, Presbyterian---it doesn't seem to make much difference to millions of American Christians. Some would say there is nothing 'notorious' about that at all. Don't we pride ourselves on being a free-market society in which consumer choice is king? Why shouldn't there be a free market also in religion---or, as it is said today, in 'spiritual preferences'? Church-hopping is simply church-shopping in search of a 'spirituality that meets my needs.' There was a time not long ago when denominational identity was much more than a matter of individual preference: 'I come from a long line of Presbyterians,' one heard it said. (Or Lutherans, or Episcopalians, or Baptists, or whatever.) Back then, it was not unusual for people to tell you why their church was right and others were wrong about issues such as infant baptism, or the Real Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, or about God's predestination of the saved and the damned.<br><br>

That time is passing, if it has not already passed. Talk about right and wrong or true and false is out. Talk about what 'meets my needs' is in. With the admittedly partial, although still notable, exception of people who are becoming Catholic. Switch from Presbyterian to Methodist, or start attending the evangelical 'megachurch' in the neighboring exurb, and you will raise few eyebrows. People who move from one denomination to another, or from the denominational to the 'nondenominational' (which is one of the biggest denominations), are exercising preferences that are, so to speak, all in the religious family. Announce that you're taking instruction to become a Catholic, however, and it is likely to prompt sharp questions. Not necessary hostile questions, mind you, but questions of intense curiosity. Why would you want to join 'them'? Catholics in America have always been the religious and, to a significant extent, cultural 'other' (3-4).
