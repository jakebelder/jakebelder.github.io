[Fr. Stephen Freeman](http://fatherstephen.wordpress.com/2007/11/30/friday-the-day-of-the-cross/):

<blockquote>
God has reconciled us to Himself through the Cross of Christ. This is not to say one thing - it is to say everything...The Cross is the explanation of everything else, while no one other thing can explain the Cross.
