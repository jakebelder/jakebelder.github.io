We are just about finished packing up our belongings, and I wanted to post a quick update before we pack up the computer. Thursday morning we are scheduled to begin our three-week long, roundabout trip to the United Kingdom. We'll first be taking a trip up north to visit our families, and then we fly out of Toronto on the 14th of July. All the while, our belongings will slowly be making their way across the Atlantic to our new home in Hull.

Needless to say, blogging will be not be happening during this time. I will be sure to pick up again once we have settled into our new life in England. For now, if you want to keep tabs on what is going on in the interim, I'll be regularly issuing updates on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakebelder). Thanks, as always, for reading, and I look forward to picking up the conversation again once we are landed in Hull.
