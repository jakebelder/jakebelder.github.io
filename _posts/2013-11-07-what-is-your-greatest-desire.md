For the early Anglican bishop, [Lancelot Andrewes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot_Andrewes), it was God himself, as he expresses so beautifully in the following passage:

<blockquote>
Thyself, o my God, Thyself for thine own sake, above all things else I love. Thyself I desire. Thyself as my last end I long for. Thyself for thine own sake, not aught else whatsoever, alway and in all things I seek, with all my heart and marrow, with groaning and weeping, with unbroken toil and grief. What wilt Thou render me therefore for my last end? It Thou render me not Thyself, Thou renderest nought: if Thou give me not Thyself, thou givest nought: if I find not Thyself, I find nought. To no purpose Thou rewardest me, but does wring me sore. For, or ever I sought Thee, I hoped to find Thee at last and to keep Thee: and with this honied hope in all my toils was I sweetly comforted. But now, if Thou have denied me Thyself, what else soever Thou give me, frustrate of so high an hope, and that not for a little space but for ever, shall I not alway languish with hope, mourn with languishing, grieve with mourning, bewail with grief, and weep for that alway I shall abide empty and void? Shall I not sorrow inconsolably, complain unceasingly, be wrung unendingly? This is not thy property, o best, most gracious, most loving God: in no sort is it congruous, no wise it sorteth. Make me therefore, o best my God, in the life present alway to love Thyself for Thyself before all things, to seek Thee in all things, and at the last in the life to come to find and to keep Thee for ever (in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0191070580/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0191070580&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21">Love's Redeeming Work: The Anglican Quest for Holiness</a></em>, 111-112).

[Abraham Kuyper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper) once wrote about [the tendency to love something *about* God rather than God himself](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/do-you-love-jesus-or-just-something-about-him), which echoes exactly what Andrewes is saying here. And that's a good reminder â€“ that as wonderful as all the blessings God promises us are, nothing is to be treasured and desired more than God himself.

We looked at Acts 7 last night with our home groups, and as you read through the account of Stephen, you realise that this desire for Christ himself is what gives him the boldness and courage he needs in the face of opposition. Recognising that he is facing certain death, he recounts the history of redemption and looks in hope to the one to whom all of history points to, longing for and desiring nothing more than to be with him.

For us today, keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus is what will enable us to press on in faithfulness as well. In a world that works so hard to capture our loves and desires and to orient us away from the goal of glorification and perfect communion and fellowship with God, [nothing is more important than having our desires rightly ordered](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/we-need-an-aversion-to-our-aversion-to-repetition-in-worship).
