<p>These sorts of videos where someone draws while another person narrates seem to be trendy these days. I've mentioned before the importance of recognising <a href="http://jakebelder.com/a-christian-perspective-on-work">the value of our work</a>, and so I found this video to be particularly good. It's so important for those in our churches to see their Monday-Saturday work as a calling, not just something they do to pay the bills. Let's keep working to help people see the <a href="http://jakebelder.com/getting-work-right">significance of their vocation</a>, and their work as an act of worship.</p>
