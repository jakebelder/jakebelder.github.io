<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ugleyvicar" target="_blank">John Richardson</a>, otherwise known as the <a href="http://ugleyvicar.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Ugley Vicar</a>, often references a document on his blog published in 1945 called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_the_conversion_of_England" target="_blank"><em>Towards the conversion of England</em></a>. It was drawn up by the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/our-faith/mission.aspx" target="_blank">Church of England's Commission on Evangelism</a> and was intended to urge churches and ministers to make the work of evangelism a priority. John often laments that the senior leadership today in the Church of England seem to have little concern for this.</p>
<p>Well, save for its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_elizabeth_ii" target="_blank">Supreme Governor</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jakebelder.com/an-inspiring-christmas-message" target="_blank">Last year</a>, she told the nation that salvation was found in Jesus Christ alone, and this year she urged her subjects to give their hearts to him. Some wish she had gone farther and been more direct, and to be sure, it may not have been the most polished presentation of the gospel, but there is no doubt that her heart is given over to the Lord, and that she would long to see many in her realm do the same. If only the Church of England would follow the lead of this most prominent evangelist.</p>

God save the Queen.
