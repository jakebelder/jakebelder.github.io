<p><a href="http://www.gordonconwell.edu/academics/view-faculty-member.cfm?faculty_id=15912&amp;grp_id=8947" target="_blank">David Wells</a> has  written, '[Prayer] is in essence rebellion &ndash; rebellion against the world  in its fallenness, the absolute and undying refusal to accept as normal  what is pervasively abnormal.' Similarly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth" target="_blank">Karl Barth</a> once wrote, 'To  clasp the hands in prayer is to rise up against the disorder of the  world.'</p>
<p>It's quite something to think that when you are praying, you are engaged in spiritual warfare. The act of praying is a subversive act. It's an openly defiant rejection of the powers that be and of the status quo. When we pray, we stand up and declare to the world, 'This is not the way it's supposed to be!' And we instead ask that God would have his way with his world, that he would set things right again, and that his Kingdom would come.</p>

So, people of God, rise up and pray.
