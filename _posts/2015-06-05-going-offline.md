After receiving some wise counsel from a friend the other day, I have decided to pull the plug on much of my online activity for the near future. That will include time off both from all social media, and from reading and writing blog posts.

Although I took a break from blogging just a couple of months ago, it is prudent for me to take a more serious break from the online world at this time, particularly as I'm at an important stage of my research that requires a good deal of concentration. Additionally, I simply need to spend more time with my family. Unlike last time, however, I am not setting a definitive date for reactivating this blog or returning to social media. It all depends on how my work goes in the next little while.

As radio DJs used to say, I'll catch you on the flip side.
