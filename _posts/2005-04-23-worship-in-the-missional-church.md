*8 March 2010: This post is reflective of the type of struggles I was going through as I moved from a very conservative, almost hyper-Calvinist church into a missional church (for lack of better term). Because it was so different from what I was used to, I spent a lot of time thinking and wrestling with the calling and nature of the church in the Western context.*

The church I have been attending for the past year and a half, Grace West Church, is a relatively recent church plant of the [Presbyterian Church in America](http://www.pcanet.org). Our current pastor, Stephen Beck, is set to move to Germany in September where he will be teaching at the [Freie Theologische Akademie in Geissen](http://www.fthgiessen.de/). I am a part of our Pastoral Search Committee there and for the past six months or so, we have been looking for a replacement pastor for the church.

This past week we flew a candidate up to visit with us and to preach for us. He looked really appealing to us in the qualities he had to offer for the church. But after hearing him preach and visiting with us, the majority of the committee decided that he was not a good fit for our church. On the way home from the meeting, it caused me to reflect a lot and I have engaged the committee in discussion via e-mail on the topic of the role that worship plays in the mission church.

Some of my understanding of the church was shaken up at the meeting, particularly when we were discussing this pastor's preaching. I personally thought his sermon was very good. I was impressed by it. But many of them indicated that they thought it lacked an evangelistic element that was crucial. When I thought about this I agreed. But this is also where I began to question. I have an understanding of worship that has been shaped by all the church's that I've been apart of, and from what I've learned in the missions classes I have taken at Redeemer. This is how it is: the church is obviously to be outreach-oriented and evangelistic all the time. This is a necessity. But how I've come to see it is that while this is to be its focus all the time, the primary purpose of the corporate worship of Sunday is edify the believers (well, of course, this comes secondary to glorifying God). Worship is supposed to be a time when through all the elements of worship (preaching, singing, prayer, fellowship, sharing the sacramentsâ€¦), members of the church are renewed and rejuvenated for the missionary calling of the church.

This is why I guess I was more positive in my feelings towards this pastor. The committee agreed that we thought his sermon was good and that we learned things from it, but that non-believers would not have. Another thing that I've been taught is that this is not necessarily a bad thing. I've learned a lot from Lesslie Newbigin, the well-known missiologist from England who spent 40 years planting churches in India. Much of what I've learned at Redeemer about mission and mission churches is based on his thought. He is the one who says that worship should appear to be something foreign to the unbeliever. They should be in the worship and recognize that Christians are an alternative community, and that they should feel uncomfortable, and thus be prodded to investigate more and ask questions.

So I said then that maybe my understanding of worship in the church is wrong or misguided and that I'm open to that. Discussion is ongoing with the committee, but I'm also interested in hearing what the blogging community has to say about this. Please, engage.
