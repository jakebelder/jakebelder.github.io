<p>We have just begun to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stott">John Stott's</a> little book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Church-Convictions-Lifelong-Pastor/dp/0830834869/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282186669&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Living Church</em></a>, together as a staff team at our church. In the first chapter, he writes about some of the defining marks of the early church as recorded in <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/NIV/Ac%202.42-47#q=acts%202%3A42-47/0&amp;ref=Ac%202%3A42-47%2Chi%3DAc%202%3A42-Ac%202%3A47&amp;ver=NIV">Acts 2:42-47</a>, one of which was a strong committment to evangelism.</p>
<p>The fervor the early church manifested in fulfilling its mission to be witnesses to the gospel of Jesus Christ is no secret, and Stott highlights the fact that the Lord blessed their efforts by "adding to their number daily those who were being saved" (Acts 2:47). He notes that "those early Christians did not regard evangelism as an occasional activity...[but] their witness was as continuous as their worship" (32).</p>
<p>Part of the reason they devoted themselves wholeheartedly to this task was because they had this eager expectation that the Spirit was actively at work drawing people to himself and believed that they were his instruments to gather the people of God from every nation, tribe, and language. They were animated by the conviction that if they faithfully proclaimed the gospel of Jesus Christ, they would see their efforts bearing fruit by the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the West as we continue to witness the rapid decline of Christianity, it is easy to lose hope in ever seeing this kind of result in our day. And our disillusionment plays a part in leading us to neglect our call to bear witness to the risen Lord. We also lose confidence in work of the Spirit, and in some instances, may even be tempted to think that the Spirit has left the church. As a result, we turn to devising all kinds of plans and methods and programs to get people to come into our churches, and hope that in the process, the Spirit comes back.</p>
<p>But the Spirit already came at Pentecost, and the reality is that <em>he has not left the church</em>! We can rejoice in this truth, and root ourselves in the knowledge that he is always with us. Jesus promised in Matthew 16:18 that he will build his church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. We are living in a time where most of his work to build his church seems to be going on in other parts of the world, but the staggering growth of the church around the world alone should remind us how amazing the work of the Spirit can be.</p>

Let us recover the eager expectation that characterized the early church and pray that God would work powerfully through us to gather his people to himself.
