In his book, *[The House Where God Lives](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802845827/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0802845827&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkId=65DBJRHXXFO435XK)*, theologian [Gary D. Badcock](http://www.huronuc.on.ca/academics/theology) discusses the significance of God calling people to himself and giving them a new identity, and how that new identity is completely bound up with being given a new mission. He writes,

<blockquote>
The church does not exist because people elect to join it for reasons relation to personal fulfilment, but because God reaches out to the world in love, calling a people into existence as his own. From the standpoint of the individual – judging from the Bible at least – being summoned by God is often a crushing experience, and it calls into existence a new identity for the person in question. In the paradigmatic call stories of the Bible, the whole meaning of a person’s existence is restructured by the mission that is entrusted to him: the person receives a new name. That a person’s name changes is symbolic of this transposition, for in the Hebraic world of the Bible, a human name signifies a corresponding human character: Abram becomes Abraham, Jacob becomes Israel, Simon becomes Peter. Furthermore, the agents of the transformation of the church, the Son and the Holy Spirit (the ‘two hands of the Father’), operate in a way that, while certainly not crushing the human desire for personal fulfilment, is certainly not merely a means to it. Instead, what they do is lay hold of us, and they gather us in so that we participate in the divine purpose and mission. There is no sign here of the spirit of consumer religion (170-171).
</blockquote>

For Christians, baptism is that summoning by God that crushes us. To go down into the water is to be stripped clean and washed of our old identity, in order to come up again out of the water raised to new life and given a new identity, marked with the seal of Christ. And because our new identity is now fully bound up with Christ, so too is the new mission we are given – to participate in the work Christ began during his time on earth of revealing and making known the Kingdom of God.

Baptism is thus not about *our* commitment to Christ, but it is about *Christ* claiming and remaking us so that, as new creations, we are now sent out to do his work in the power of the Spirit. No longer do we live for our own purposes, but only for the purpose to which Christ has called us.  A new name means a new mission.
