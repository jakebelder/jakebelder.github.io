<p>One of the newer bits of technology that an increasing number of cars are equipped with is a parking assist feature. Many cars have sensors in the rear bumper that will cause a beep to sound inside the cabin when you are close to hitting something while reversing. The <a href="http://www.lincoln.com/suvs/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a>, to use one example, has sensors all around the vehicle, not just in the rear bumper. While many might consider this a convenient feature, in my case, it ends up being a bit of an annoyance. I am often required to park cars in tight spaces, and when parking the Navigator the other day, the sensors went ballistic when I got too close (in its opinion) to a car in front of me, beside me, and to a few pylons on the other side of me. Sorry, Lincoln. The vehicle had to go there, even if it meant I couldn't open the doors all the way.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only one of the many 'driving aids' that manufacturers are installing on vehicles today. Some cars have an automated cruise control, such that when the cruise is set and you approach another vehicle the car will adjust the speed to match the vehicle in front of you, while others have sensors that warn you if you wander out of your lane on the highway. Still other cars have the ability to park themselves. Indeed, many foresee a future of driver-less cars.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this technology that is designed to make driving easier? There are definite benefits, the most notable being that many of these technological advances are designed to prevent accidents and ensure safer driving conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But do they make us better drivers? Of course not. In fact, I think they contribute to the increasing desire of many people to take on as little responsibility as possible.</p>
<p>The ability to drive gives you an extraordinary amount of power. You have a great deal of independence, being able to get in the vehicle and go wherever you please. But more important is the responsibility you assume for others. When I was learning to drive, I remember both my dad and my driving instructor telling me that as soon as you get into your car, you have taken the lives of others into your hands, whether it be pedestrians, other drivers, or the friends you drive to the movie theatre.</p>
<p>The safety benefits of some of the new features different cars are equipped with are certainly to be lauded. But I think it is worth noting that such features also contribute to drivers thinking less of the responsibility they take on when driving a car. People begin to put their faith in the car to keep them safe. Humans are fallible and make mistakes, but so do machines. And with the passing of responsibility from the driver to the car itself, what happens when one of these features fails to operate as it should, and the driver is not paying as much attention as they should?</p>

<p>Driving has evolved in other ways as well. What used to be a pleasure (driving) has now turned into a chore (commuting). This is particularly the case in North America. People want to do as little as possible when driving, and so the vast majority of cars are equipped with things like automatic transmissions and cruise control. No longer is a driver responsible for what the car itself is doing, nor are they praised for their ability to smoothly and&nbsp;skilfully&nbsp;operate and&nbsp;manoeuvre&nbsp;the vehicle. And they want to be as comfortable as possible, which entails buying a lot of large vehicles with soft suspensions, big, plush seats, and state of the art stereo systems and DVD players. Driving is all about getting places now. No longer do people go out for a Sunday drive just for the sake of <em>driving</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <em><a href="http://www.caranddriver.com">Car and Driver</a></em> magazine launched a campaign some time ago called '<a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/save_the_manuals!-car_and_driver">Save the Manuals</a>', an attempt to reignite people's interest in driving the entire car. They note too that the added responsibility that comes with driving a manual means that you have to focus more on driving (you can't text while driving a manual), which in turn produces safer drivers. You don't have enough hands to shift gears, operate a cell phone, change CDs, program the navigator and balance a coffee cup. And that's precisely the point. I fully intend to teach my child how to drive in a car with a manual transmission.</p>

Maybe I'm just a purist.&nbsp;I want a car with firm handling and a solid ride so I can&nbsp;feel the road when I'm driving. I want a manual transmission because I want control over what the car is doing. And few things give me more pleasure than a twisty back road with minimal traffic and lots of scenery. More than that, though, I want other drivers out there to be aware of the enormous responsibility they take on when operating a 4000-pound vehicle at 70 miles per hour. And so while we praise the continued technological advances of new cars, we cannot forget the responsibility that comes with getting behind the wheel of an automobile. Anybody who forgets that simply should not be allowed to drive.
