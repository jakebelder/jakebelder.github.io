<p>I like confessional documents. The <a href="http://www.crcna.org/pages/heidelberg_main.cfm" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a>, the <a href="http://www.opc.org/confessions.html" target="_blank">Westminster Standards</a>, the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx" target="_blank">39 Articles</a> &ndash; I am a fan of all of them. When I was growing up, my family belonged to a <a href="http://www.crcna.org" target="_blank">Christian Reformed</a> church, and as a young catechumen, I was made to memorise a good amount of the Heidelberg Catechism, something I really did not enjoy doing at the time but for which I am very grateful now.</p>
<p>Every confessional denomination finds itself having an ongoing conversation about the role the confessions they subscribe to will play. Throughout my time in university and later in seminary, my wife and I belonged to churches affiliated with the <a href="http://www.pcanet.org" target="_blank">Presbyterian Church in America</a>, which has recently seen this issue come up in some notable ways, particularly <a href="http://apologus.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/jason-stellman-resigns-from-the-presbyterian-church-in-america/" target="_blank">with the recent resignation of one of its ministers</a>, who is moving towards Roman Catholicism. Though the PCA is not a denomination that requires strict subscription to the Westminster Standards, there is a group within the denomination that repeatedly calls for it and maintains that to be truly Reformed, one must fully suscribe to the Standards. Interestingly, the minister in question comes from this camp.</p>

<p>The ins and outs of this particular situation are covered well <a href="http://www.leithart.com/2012/06/04/whos-got-the-gateway-drug/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.barlowfarms.com/index/cm_id/1868314" target="_blank">here</a>, so I won't say more on that. However, it does raise many questions about confessionalism in general, which are worth talking about. But as I have said quite a lot on the subject of confessionalism on this blog before, all I want to do now is say a few things in summary, pointing back to what I've written previously.</p>
<p>In the first place, as the authors of the two posts I link to above both say, it is important to reocgnise that there are great dangers in holding to a strict confessionalism. One often ends up granting the confessions the same authority as Scripture, or even more in some cases (in practice, anyway; this would almost certainly never be acknowledged). In part, I understand that this is a response to an unhealthy appropriation of the idea of <em>sola Scriptura</em>. The Reformers themselves were wary of the dangers of this doctrine, and went to great lengths to ensure it was understood properly. Part of the reason the confessions were written was to <a href="http://jakebelder.com/the-bible-is-not-for-you" target="_blank">help prevent the sort of "me and my Bible" subjectivity</a> that is commonplace in evangelicalism today. One of the roles of the confessions, then, is to ensure the church handles the Bible correctly.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper" target="_blank">Abraham Kuyper</a> has written that the confessions serve the church <a href="http://jakebelder.com/kuyper-again-the-church-as-our-guide" target="_blank">by acting as guides</a> and by <a href="http://jakebelder.com/kuyper-on-the-confessional-life-of-the-church" target="_blank">establishing theological boundaries</a> that keep the church on the path of biblical orthodoxy. There is an objective authority granted to the church by the Holy Spirit, which gives the communal interpretation of Scripture precedence over that of the individual. Of course, this is a fine line to walk, because in saying this we are one step away from the sort of rigid confessionalism that elevates the confessions to the status of a magisterium. In the end, confessions are only as good as their fidelity to Scripture, which has the ultimate authority, and which alone can bind the conscience of the individual.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rts.edu/Seminary/Faculty/bio.aspx?id=502" target="_blank">John Frame</a>, who once taught at a seminary that functions as something of a 'headquarters' for the strict confessionalist camp, has frequently been hauled on the carpet for his unwillingness to assent to their form of confessionalism by demonstrating to their satisfaction that his theology conforms to the confessions. Anyone who knows Frame or has read anything by him knows that he is ultimately concerned with rooting his theology in Scripture, and so these sort of accusations essentially charge Frame with wrongdoing for appealing to the Bible before the confessions. For this reason, accusing him of being a bad confessionalist is simply absurd. He should instead <a href="http://jakebelder.com/sola-scriptura-and-healthy-confessionalism" target="_blank">be held up as an exemplar of healthy confessionalism</a>, because his subscription to the confessions is wholly based on their conformity to Scripture.</p>

Much more could be said, and this certainly is a conversation worth having. For now, though, it is important to realise that what is ultimately at stake is the authority of Scripture. Confessions do play a vital role in the church, and we need to recognise that. But when they become the final authority in matters of theology, they have become nothing less than idols.
