<p>Sin is so frequently misunderstood that among Christians there are a myriad of perspectives on what it is and how it affects both us and the world around us. This should surprise us, though, because the Bible is rather clear on the fact that sin is the result of humanity's wilful rebellion against God and affects the entirety of God's creation. <a href="http://www.langhampartnership.org/about-us/lpi-leadership/chris-wright/">Christopher J.H. Wright</a>, in a chapter on the biblical paradigms of redemption in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844743748/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1844743748"><em>Transforming the World?</em></a> writes of the scope of sin:</p>
<blockquote>
It is clear that the Bible offers us a very radical assessment of the effects of our willful rebellion and fall into disobedience, self-centredness and sin. It is not just that every dimension of the human person is affected by sin. It is not just that every human person is a sinner. It is also the case that the totality of our social and economic relationships with each other, horizontally and historically, and of our ecological relationship to the earth itself have all been perverted and twisted.
</blockquote>
<p>Underlying this perspective is the understanding that the totality of created reality is originally good, and sin has perverted that goodness. <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/wolters.htm">Albert Wolters</a>, in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802829694/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802829694"><em>Creation Regained</em></a>, describes sin as a parasite, which is something entirely different and alien to the creation, but leeches on to it at every point, distorting it and masking the original goodness. Without this understanding, it is very easy for Christians to fall into the trap of viewing some parts of creation as good but affected by sin, and others as neutral or even inherently sinful. This most commonly works itself out in the 'sacred/secular' dichotomy, which elevates our spiritual life above the rest of our daily existence.</p>
<p>But as God is committed to the whole of his creation, promising to liberate it from sin, so should we be committed to bearing witness to the redemption that comes through Jesus Christ in every part of our creaturely existence. A war is being waged between Christ and Satan for the totality of creation, and at every point we insist that something is insignificant or inherently sinful and deny its original created goodness, we yield to Satan. We must instead fight on the side of Christ, working to demonstrate his rule as the true King over all of creation.</p>
<p>Much more could be said on this (<a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/32633-if-christ-is-lord-everything-matters.html">I've written on it elsewhere recently</a>), and a great place to start is by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0802829694/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0802829694">Wolters' book</a>.</p>
