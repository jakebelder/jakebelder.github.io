Our church was built in 1833, and up until recently, featured pews that had been installed sometime in the 1860s. Last summer, we reordered the church so that we would face the south wall, removed the pews, and purchased several hundred chairs to be used in their place. The results were fantastic, and many of our parishioners have noted that the change has made the building feel like a whole new church.

Before the changes to the building were completed, I would sometimes hear people comment that they weren't particularly in favour of the changes because they preferred 'traditional' church buildings. That is an interesting comment because pews can hardly be considered traditional – they only date [from about the time of the Reformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew). As preaching became more central in the worship of Protestant churches during the Reformation, pews were installed so people could sit and listen. Yet, for the all that was achieved in the Reformation to re-involve the people in the act of worship, [Aidan Kavanagh](http://www.yale.edu/divinity/news/060713_news_kavanagh.shtml), in his book, *[Elements of Rite](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0814660541/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0814660541&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21)*, makes an interesting remark about how pews actually *hinder* their involvement:

<blockquote>
Pews, which entered liturgical place only recently, nail the assembly down, proclaiming that the liturgy is not a common action but a preachment perpetrated upon the seated, an ecclesiastical opera done by virtuosi for a paying audience. Pews distance the congregation, disenfranchise the faithful, and rend the assembly (21).
</blockquote>

It is clear that, for the sake of argument, Kavanagh is making some rather strong assertions, which may not be true of every church that has pews – indeed, I would not say that this was characteristic of our church before we removed the pews. Nonetheless, there are a lot of benefits to removing pews from churches, benefits we have really noticed in our own church. From [the perspective of the preacher](https://twitter.com/jakebelder/status/399997333087473664), it has brought the congregation much closer, and enables a great deal more interaction with the hearers. When we sing, we can now see those around us and across on the other side of the church, which encourages us. We can easily spot who is worshipping with us, which, amongst other things, enables us to notice visitors and to welcome them. It makes the space much more flexible and usable for different purposes (some of [the recent photos on our Facebook page illustrate this well](https://www.facebook.com/stjohnnewland/photos_stream)). And our sense of being a family gathered around Scripture and the Lord's Table is much more real as we actually, in a more literal way, circle in around these things.

Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. And while that sense of wanting to preserve something that has come down to us from previous generations can be healthy in the right context, in others it can have detrimental effects. When it comes to ministry, we always have to be willing to give up what our aesthetic sensibilities might prefer for the sake of the gospel. If our buildings don't serve the mission of the church, they need to be changed.

I realise this raises a number of other issues, not least whether we should spend significant amounts of our resources on buildings, but that is perhaps a discussion for another time.
