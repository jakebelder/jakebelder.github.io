<p>If you are connected with me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jakebelder">Facebook</a> or follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a>, you would have seen a few days ago that we finally received the visas we have been waiting for to move to England. It has been ten months since we first started working through all the paperwork, and have had to go through an extensive process to get the church approved to be a sponsor, and to get the actual visas. But finally, by God's grace, they are in our hands.</p>
<p>In case you are a relatively new follower of this blog and don't know what I am talking about, I will be <a href="http://jakebelder.com/some-news-about-our-future">taking up a position</a> as an assistant minister at <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/">St John's Church</a> in the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston-Upon-Hull">Hull</a>. As an assistant minister, I will be taking part in the pastoral responsibilities at the church, in addition to overseeing and coordinating the church's <a href="http://stjohnnewland.org.uk/cap.htm">community outreach work</a>. There are a lot of great opportunities to serve and minister to this church and this city, and I am very excited and grateful that God has opened this door for us.</p>
<p>Our plans are to leave Florida on 23 June, and begin to make our way north, visiting Robin's family in Michigan and my family in Ontario for a few weeks before we fly out of Toronto and arrive in England on the morning of 15 July.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there are a lot of things that need to be done before this, especially sorting through all our belongings and determining what we want to take with us and what we want to sell or get rid of. Given that, expect blogging to be a little more sparse for the next few months. I'll continue to update as we move forward.</p>

Your prayers, as always, are greatly appreciated as we prepare both for our move and for ministry in the UK.
