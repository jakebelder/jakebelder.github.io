This past Sunday, I preached on John 17:1-5, the first portion of Jesus’ great prayer before he is arrested and goes to the cross. Part of the sermon was given over to exploring Jesus’ request, ‘Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.’

Prior to this, I don’t think I had ever thought much about what exactly it means for us to see God’s glory. One of the things I kept seeing highlighted as I was preparing was that God’s display of his glory is an act of revelation. That display of glory reveals to us something about who he is, something about his character. And that is exactly what Jesus’ request is – that the Father will reveal to us, in his death, resurrection, and ascension, the fullness of who Christ is. It is in that great act of redemption that we see Jesus in all his beauty and splendour.

This got me thinking about what it means for us as Christians to glorify God in all that we do. I didn’t address that point in the sermon, but I thought this would be a good forum to make a few observations. Christians often talk about glorifying God in all that we do, and rightly so, because that is something Scripture calls us to do (such as in 1 Corinthians 10:31). But what do we mean when we say that?

It seems to me that ‘glorifying God’ often simply equates with following his laws and standards. That, of course, is a key part of living faithfully before him; after all, [as our covenant Lord, his commands give shape to our lives](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/redemption-enables-us-to-keep-being-human). Perhaps, though, we ought also to understand the call to glorify God in connection with the understanding that God’s display of his glory is an act of self-revelation. So then when we glorify God, we too partake in revealing him to the world as his character is displayed in and through us.

We see this in the example of Old Testament Israel. God gave Israel a law that would shape their life according to his design, and while obeying the law was an end in itself insofar as the covenant was concerned, Israel's collective life, lived faithfully, was to be a display to the nations around them of who their God was. They lived their life ‘in public’ and the whole of their life was to be a witness to Yahweh and his character, drawing the nations in to discover the fullness of life lived in submission to this great King and to find the salvation that he alone could offer. His glory was to be displayed in and through them.

This perspective turns our focus outwards. No less than Israel, [we as the church live our lives in public as well](http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/we-live-in-public). We are on display to the world around us. Our concern to live faithfully before God should go beyond just ensuring that we are living according to his norms and standards, as important as that is. We need to be concerned that the world around us does not just see us, but sees our great and beautiful God in and through all that we think, do, and say. A concern to glorify God in everything is an inherently evangelistic concern, a concern to bear faithful witness to the risen and ascended Lord Jesus who has given us life and with whom we are united, and to make known the life and salvation that he alone can give.

These are just some scattered thoughts that I jotted down the other day, but I’d be interested in thinking this through further, and welcome your contributions to the conversation.
