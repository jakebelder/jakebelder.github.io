I have been reading Robert Scott's book, *The Gothic Enterprise*, a book about the great cathedrals of Europe, what was involved in building them and what kind of mindset and culture existed that influenced their construction. One of the fascinating things perhaps is the environment in which these cathedrals were constructed in. People in medieval society battled incredibly brutal living conditions, unstable societies, and a period of rather severe and unpredictable weather patterns. Yet besides these inhospitable conditions, they built some of the most magnificent structures in human history.

In the conclusion of his book, Scott makes some interesting observations about the role that culture played during this time. While we live surrounded by extensive social networks to take care of all of our needs and protect us from so many of the variables that the world and life itself can throw at us, people in medieval Europe had none. Scott says,

<blockquote>
[The medieval period] of history we have been discussing had no 911 number to dial. The core institutions of those societies were, by modern standards, underdeveloped, nonexistent, or powerless to protect their members. About all that stood between people and chaos was their culture. The culture embodied and celebrated beliefs that imparted to everyday life a sense of order, safety, and certainty that it otherwise lacked, and this culture also transmitted the knowledge necessary to manage and survive day by day from one generation to the next.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Because culture made human existence possible and tolerable, because a people's sole source of protection and security was shared beliefs, it became important to make this system appear larger than life itself. Making communitas appear powerful and efficacious was a way of reassuring people that they did not stand alone against the terrifying forces of nature and the difficult conditions of human life. Planning and executing incredible feats of construction is a tangible way of empowering the culture that protects us. Mundane activities can never compete, because they are too easily taken for granted or dismissed as unexceptional or ordinary. A Stonehenge, a pyramid of Giza, or a magnificent Gothic cathedral cannot be disregarded in the same way. All three evoke in us the same sense of amazement and awe that ordinary people using ordinary materials could built them" (249).
</blockquote>

So while one of the reasons the cathedral may have been built was to guard against heresy (see my earlier post), it was done for far more extensive reasons than that. A society that was so deeply rooted in fear needed something to bind them together to face the onslaught of a very difficult life. If you know more about the cathedrals, it becomes easy to criticize the builders, designers, and rulers behind the movement for their theology or their motives. But when you allow yourself to enter into the medieval mindset of the common peasant, things look quite a bit different.
