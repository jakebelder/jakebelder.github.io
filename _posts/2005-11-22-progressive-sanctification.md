**Simple Definition:** A continuous Christian growth in holiness. Click for longer definition.

**Illustration:** From Scott Sherman, pastor of City Church San Francisco. He told the story, "I once knew a man in New York City, when I was a pastor there, and he was a former gang member. He came up to me one day and said, 'Yesterday walking down the street I was confronted by a man who pulled a knife on me. So I pulled out my gun and shot him in the knee caps.' Bursting into tears of joy, the man continued, 'But Praise the Lord! A year ago I would've shot him in the head!'"
