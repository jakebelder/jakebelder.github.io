Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 281px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/BibleOnPulpit.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>14-20 July 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12zHdxU">How To Read Hard (and Old) Books</a></strong> – Here is a helpful post with a few tips on how to read primary sources. The author wants us to stop going to sources that offer summaries or interpretations of the primary sources, and instead heed that great Renaissance call, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_fontes"><em>Ad fontes</a>!</em></li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dyQdVE">Planting Deep Roots</a></strong> – Here is a great piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/ahc">Andy Crouch</a> on why institutions are so crucial for culture change. He writes, "For cultural change to grow and persist, it has to be institutionalized, meaning it must become part of the fabric of human life through a set of learnable and repeatable patterns. It must be transmitted beyond its founding generation to generations yet unborn."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12zIntg">A Protestant Appreciation of <em>Lumen fidei</em></a></strong> – Pope Francis' first encyclical was recently released, and <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> here offers some reflections on some of the main themes in the encyclical. Smith notes that it is "a beautiful articulation of the Christian faith for our postmodern world."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12zJI3m">Why Pastors Should Blog</a></strong> – There are a number of posts out there dealing with this question already, but I think it's good to think about the practice of blogging as a pastor. I do it regularly, of course, and largely for the purpose of helping me think things through, which is one of the reasons this author suggests we blog.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dySY9n">The Secret to Finland's Success With Schools, Moms, Kids—and Everything</a></strong> – I've long been interested in Finland for a long time, and so I am interested when articles are written about the country, something which is happening with increasing frequency. It's surprising more people don't move there given how much praise it seems to receive. Maybe it's the language.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18jLSsq">Sermons should be arguments</a></strong> – A brief thought from <a href="http://twitter.com/mbird12">Michael Bird</a> on why sermons should make an argument. I wonder if it is an implicit critique of poorly executed expository preaching.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15AJUO9">Biggest Mistakes Young Preachers Make</a></strong> – Here is a short video discussing some of the common mistakes young preachers make. This echoes a lot of the things I reflected on last year <a href="http://blog.jakebelder.com/post/things-ive-learned-from-a-year-of-preaching">when I thought about my first year of preaching</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/18n8Rmq">The Opening Question (Torrey 101)</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/FredFredSanders">Fred Sanders</a> writes about the method of teaching used at the <a href="http://www.biola.edu/academics/torrey/">Torrey Honors Institute</a>, and makes some interesting observations about how to ask questions to best foster discussion.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13j2tYI">Shut Up and Let God Speak</a></strong> – Here is a very interesting post from <a href="http://twitter.com/ARStager">Andy Stager</a> discussing how we talk about the Bible during worship. He suggests that corporate worship is not the place to be defending the Bible.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1br8sjb">What Can Infants Really Get Out of Church?</a></strong> – This post makes an important point that is often overlooked: children take in far more through observation and experience that we think they do.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1br8PKk">Trying to attract the young? Churches should change carefully and wisely</a></strong> – An interesting article written by someone who grew up in a traditional church, walked away from church, came back to a hip and trendy non-denominational church, and then found her way to an Anglican church. Her point is simply that churches shouldn't be changing the way they do things simply to try and keep young people in. Instead, she says, "take the long view."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1br9mfz">Christians in Brazil: To Protest or Not to Protest?</a></strong> – The ongoing protests in Brazil are raising some interesting questions about Christians and their involvement with protests and the political scene.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1buO3K1">The 50 Most Perfectly Timed Photos Ever</a></strong> – Some of these photos are quite amusing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12RGZhj">A different kind of coming out</a></strong> – This is a really encouraging interview with a few ministers in the UK who struggle with same-sex attraction but are determined to live faithfully. Christians who want to be faithful to what the Bible teaches about sexuality should be grateful for guys like this who are open about their struggles and committed to submitting their sexuality to the Lordship of Christ. We need more people like this.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15PFxPt">Young Evangelicals Are Getting High</a></strong> – Another interesting article about young people finding homes in more liturgical churches. I would say some things differently, but the conclusion is spot on: "Perhaps if Protestant churches began acting more like dutiful mothers instead of fun babysitters, there would be fewer youth leaving their ecclesiastical homes as soon as they are out of the house."</li>
