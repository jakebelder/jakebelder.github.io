<p>Although he taught at <a href="http://www.redeemer.ca">Redeemer University College</a> for most of the time I studied there, I never had the privilege of taking a class with <a href="http://www.redeemer.ca/faculty/craig-bartholomew.aspx">Craig Bartholomew</a>. I have benefited from his wisdom in other ways, however, particularly through his contributions to the two books he co-authored with Mike Goheen, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0281057400/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0281057400"><em>The Drama of Scripture: Finding our Place in the Biblical Story</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0281058865/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakebeldercom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0281058865"><em>Living at the Crossroads: An Introduction to Christian Worldview</em></a> (and I highly recommend both of them).</p>
<p>Bartholomew is now involved with <a href="http://www.paideiacentre.ca/">The Paideia Centre for Public Theology</a>, an exciting venture with links to <a href="http://www.trinity-bris.ac.uk">Trinity College, Bristol</a>, and a more informal relationship with Redeemer, that aims to develop "a new generation  of Christian scholars with the vision of incarnating  the Gospel in all areas of life."</p>
<p>In April, the Centre hosted <a href="http://www.paideiacentre.ca/paideia-gathers">a conference</a> in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Bartholomew gave one of the main lectures, which I've embedded below (you can listen to the other talks <a href="http://www.paideiacentre.ca/resources/audio/2012/03/audio-from-paideia-gathers-chattanooga-2012">here</a>). I was particularly impressed by the challenge he put forward. If I came to your city, he said, where, besides the churches, would I see Christ? In other words, if I went to visit those of you who are lawyers, would I see that Christ is Lord over the practice of law? If I went to visit those of you are in business, would I see that the Lordship of Christ shapes how you do business? If I went to visit those of you who are artists, carpenters, and so on, would it be evident that you do everything in service to him? Christ will be seen in a powerful way in our cities when all of us strive to live faithfully under the Lordship of Christ in every area of life.</p>

Equipping Christians to do just that is one of the aims of the Paideia Centre, and that is part of what Bartholomew addresses in the lecture. [Download the talk](http://www.paideiacentre.ca/resources/audio/2012/03/audio-from-paideia-gathers-chattanooga-2012) and take forty-five minutes to listen to it as you commute to work. It is well worth your time.
