<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_hippo">Saint Augustine</a>, in his role as the bishop of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippo_Regius">Hippo</a>, would frequently note that he understood his primary responsibility to be the preaching and exposition of Scripture. But on the anniversary of his ordination, he preached <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sermons-306-340-Works-Saint-Augustine/dp/1565480686">a sermon</a> that gave a little more insight into his other pastoral responsibilites as bishop. He asked for their prayers, for the work of a bishop and a pastor was no small calling:</p>
<blockquote>
The turbulent have to be corrected, the faint-hearted cheered up, the weary supported; the gospel's opponents need to be refuted, its insiduous enemies guarded against; the unlearned need to be taught, the indolent stirred up, the argumentative checked; the proud must be put in their place, the desperate set on their feet, those engaged in quarrels reconciled; the needy have to be helped, the oppressed to be liberated, the good to be given your backing, the bad to be tolerated; all must be loved.
</blockquote>
