Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. For those who don't use Twitter but are interested in reading or perusing the links, they are collected here and posted at the end of the week.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 1px 0px 20px; width: 400px; height: 258px;"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3897986/Jake%20Blog%20Images/hamilton%20by%20jake.jpg"></div>
Here are the links from <strong>01-07 September 2013</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1a2PIU2">Packer on the Gospels</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyhill">Wesley Hill</a> quotes J.I. Packer, who says that the Gospels are central to understanding what discipleship looks like. This in particular struck me: 'Some Christians seem to prefer the epistles as if this were a mark of growing up spiritually; but really this attitude is a very bad sign, suggesting that we are more interested in theological notions than in fellowship with the Lord Jesus in person.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1a2PVXn">Top 20 Countries where Christianity is Growing the Fastest</a></strong> – I know that statistics like this can sometimes be misleading and inaccurate, but this is quite interesting nonetheless.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1a2QLn6">A pastor's time management</a></strong> – I was asked by my friend, <a href="http://twitter.com/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a>, to write a piece for <a href="http://www.fieldnotesmagazine.com">Fieldnotes Magazine</a> on the challenges pastors face managing their time. In no way do I claim to be an expert on this matter – I can recognise the challenges, but I'm only just learning to figure out the solutions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14q5bJu">We Believe in Institutions</a></strong> – This is <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith's</a> excellent editorial from the most recent issue of <a href="http://www.cardus.ca/comment"><em>Comment</em> magazine</a>, on the importance of institutions and why Christians should care about them. It comes down to this: 'If you care about the welfare of your city, take ownership of the institutions around you.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14q5Tqe">Yes, I'm the Mechanic</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/ct_city">This is our City</a> sometimes puts together these short films about people seeking <em>shalom</em> in the cities they live in. I especially loved this most recent one, partly because I thought about becoming a mechanic at one point when I was younger, and partly because it's such a great story of vocational faithfulness and of someone seeking the common good in their own city.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/N2kl7tqpnY4">The City Harmonic – A City on a Hill</a></strong> – I enjoyed this new music video because it was filmed in my hometown and is from a band that comes from my hometown.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1dJ800R">True Anglicanism</a></strong> – Many people say you can't easily define the Anglican tradition, but this post argues otherwise. The author writes, 'Anglicanism is simply the revival of biblical religion on English soil... authentic Anglicanism must be gauged by the twin ideals of Scriptural teaching and Reformational confessionalism... [It] is nothing more than an endeavour to reproduce the faith of Sacred Scripture in witness, worship, and pastoral care.'</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17UQ8xu">Evangelism is Living Where You Live</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/revchadbrooks">Chad Brooks</a>, in a helpful post, writes about the importance of being present in your community and intentionally being in places where you have opportunities to foster relationships with people.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/17UQrII">False Freedom and the Slavery of Autonomy</a></strong> – And to close this week's list, here is an excellent post by <a href="http://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> on the importance of community in the Christian life.</li>
