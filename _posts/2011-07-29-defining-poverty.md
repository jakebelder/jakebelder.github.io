<p>According to Harvie Conn and Manuel Ortiz, in their book, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/qfgLnB">Urban Ministry: The Kingdom, the City, and the People of God</a></em>, Mother Theresa once visited the Bronx and said that the people there suffered from a far worse poverty than the people of Calcutta. At face value, it seems like an odd statement to make &ndash; how can you even compare such radically different contexts &ndash; but it makes more sense when you adopt a more nuanced definition of poverty, such as one <a href="http://amzn.to/r7qkso">Viv Grigg proposes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Absolute poverty</em> is a term used to describe poverty when people have an absolute insufficiency to meet their basic needs... <em>Relative poverty</em> is found in the developed world and is measured by looking at a person's standard of living relative to others in the community or nation... It is a measure of the extent to which people are on the margins of society.
</blockquote>
<p>Conn and Ortiz add that poor people living the Bronx have a much harder time dealing with their poverty because they live side by side with some of the most prosperous people in the world. Their poverty, then, is not so much an absence of material goods, but a poverty of identity. They have a sense of hopelessness, of failure and inferiority. Donald McGavran has written, 'Being poor and hopeless in a society where most are not produces a deep sense of alienation.' Conn and Ortiz continue,</p>
<blockquote>
The word most connected with poverty is <em>powerlessness</em>... [<a href="http://amzn.to/qbEfvU">David Claerbaut</a> writes,] "Poverty means much more than the absence of money. It is powerlessness and alienation from key institutions of society... The urban poor are almost completely cut off from the wider society and yet are oppressively controlled by it." <a href="http://amzn.to/rt21hJ">[Robert] Linthicum</a> explains, "To truly undertand the condition of poverty today, one must understand how power is exercised in the city. Poverty...is the absence of power &ndash; the capability of being able to change one's situation."
</blockquote>
<p>I read this section with interest because Hull is something of a deprived area, and our church is trying to figure out how best to meet the needs here. There is high unemployment, and the percentage of child poverty in this city is reportedly over 30%. Defining poverty as something more than just the absence of material goods is helpful because it helps us get a fix on the fact that the needs go beyond money, food, and clothes. And so, to deal with the problem of poverty will necessarily involve a great deal more than just throwing money at those in need.</p>

'Our response to this situation,' write Conn and Ortiz, 'ought to be the same as God's. [According to Linthicum,] the cities that house the poor have forced the poor "to live lives that break God's heart and should break ours, as well."'
