<p>You might recall a <a href="http://jakebelder.com/a-few-reading-tips">post a few months ago with some tips and advice on reading</a> from <a href="http://cpjustice.org/gideonstrauss">Gideon Strauss</a>.  I'm revisiting the reading tips again today, and these present tips concern those sorts of books which you may choose to mark up, those which you may have to read for school or just think are worth the time and effort to really delve into.  Today's advice comes from the late  <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Adler">Mortimer J. Adler</a> (via <a href="http://stevebishop.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/some-useful-advice-when-reading-a-book/">Steve Bishop</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
There are all kinds of devices for marking a book intelligently and fruitfully. Here&rsquo;s the way I do it:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Underlining (or highlighting): of major points, of important or forceful statements.</li>
<li>Vertical lines at the margin: to emphasize a statement already underlined.</li>
<li>Star, asterisk, or other doo-dad at the margin: to be used sparingly, to emphasize the ten or twenty most important statements in the book. (You may want to fold the bottom comer of each page on which you use such marks. It won&rsquo;t hurt the sturdy paper on which most modern books are printed, and you will be able take the book off the shelf at any time and, by opening it at the folded-corner page, refresh your recollection of the book.)</li>
<li>Numbers in the margin: to indicate the sequence of points the author makes in developing a single argument.</li>
<li>Numbers of other pages in the margin: to indicate where else in the book the author made points relevant to the point marked; to tie up the ideas in a book, which, though they may be separated by many pages, belong together.</li>
<li>Circling or highlighting of key words or phrases.</li>
<li>Writing in the margin, or at the top or bottom of the page, for the sake of: recording questions (and perhaps answers) which a passage raised in your mind; reducing a complicated discussion to a simple statement; recording the sequence of major points right through the books. I use the end-papers at the back of the book to make a personal index of the author&rsquo;s points in the order of their appearance.</li>
</ul>

The front end-papers are to me the most important. Some people reserve them for a fancy bookplate. I reserve them for fancy thinking. After I have finished reading the book and making my personal index on the back end-papers, I turn to the front and try to outline the book, not page by page or point by point (I&rsquo;ve already done that at the back), but as an integrated structure, with a basic unity and an order of parts. This outline is, to me, the measure of my understanding of the work.

Given that I'm a seminary student and have to work my way through a lot of different books, I found these tips especially helpful.  It is always good to have your own system for marking up a book, something that works for you.  I employ a lot of the same techniques Adler does, my weapons of choice being a 0.7mm mechanical pencil and a small ruler for underlining.  I know some people are averse to marking up books, but I'm not.  When I open the book and right away see certain things underlined or the various notes in the margins, I begin to quickly recollect the information I thought important on the pages.

Also, earlier today <a href="http://www.jameskasmith.com/">James K. A. Smith</a> was asked some questions about reading <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://forsclavigera.blogspot.com/2009/08/reading-habits.html">which he posted on his blog</a>.  Be sure to check those out as well because he offers some good advice derived from his own reading habits.
