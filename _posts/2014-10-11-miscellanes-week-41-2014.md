Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>05-11 October 2014</strong>.

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/Z5t8cl">These 75 Iconic Photos Will Define The 21st Century So Far</a></strong> – The title is pretty superfluous (and I even left off the worst part of it), but this is a great collection of photos, and I think a lot of these will certainly be enduring images of this century.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1vL6yCR">The Image of God & You</a></strong> – A great post from <a href="http://twitter.com/JordanBallor">Jordan Ballor</a>, who writes, 'As great a challenge and responsibility as it can be to recognize and affirm the image of God in other people, it is likewise often difficult to see God’s image in <em>ourselves</em>... We must [learn to] live in a way that is worthy of our honored status as God’s imagebearers."</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1vJCt4x">Pursue God: How God Pulls Us to Himself</a></strong> – Here is an excellent piece by <a href="http://twitter.com/james_ka_smith">James K.A. Smith</a> on the relationship between vocation and worship. He rightly says the two are inseparable, as worship trains our hearts to desire the right things, equipping us to do our work for the sake of Christ and his Kingdom.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1s0u6Ru">Richard Hays and the New Testament’s Witness on Homosexuality</a></strong> – A summary of the chapter on homosexuality from Richard Hays' book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0567085694/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0567085694&linkCode=as2&tag=jakebeldercom-21&linkId=ACWUSG43CZLIGLZC">The Moral Vision of the New Testament</a></em>, which N.T. Wright suggests is the best brief treatment on the issue.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ZhrDrR">Sexuality and Silence</a></strong> – This is a helpful post from <a href="http://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a> on why churches should not remain silent on controversial ethical and moral issues. We need to be a voice of clarity amidst all the confusion.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1sr85x3">Bible in the Raw</a></strong> – Here is a good piece on the <a href="http://twitter.com/fulcrumanglican">Fulcrum</a> blog on the subject of Bible translation, which includes a bit of a call to consider learning the original languages.</li>
