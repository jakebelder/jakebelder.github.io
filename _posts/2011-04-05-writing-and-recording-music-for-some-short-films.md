A friend of mine from church, [Eric Horner](http://www.youtube.com/Cnior), is a filmmaker, and one of his latest projects has been making short inspirational films. He has people say a few things about who are they are, what they like, and so on, and then films them doing an activity they enjoy. Most recently he created some for two young girls in our church, and when he had finished, he approached me about composing and recording some music for the films. I thought it would be a good challenge, and so I took him up on the offer.

This past Sunday afternoon we spent a few hours at the church recording the music. For our first try, I think it turned out pretty well. The church is not equipped with state of the art recording equipment, but we were able to lay down a few tracks with the various instruments and then Eric was able to mix what we recorded. For the first film we used piano, drums, a synth, and a bass guitar. The second uses a guitar, djembe, and some human instrumentation in the form of whistling and clapping.

I'm pretty impressed with the finished product. Eric is very, very good at what he does, and I'm grateful for the opportunity he gave me to write some music. And it was a lot of fun recording it all. So, without further ado, here are the films.

<p>Eric also filmed us as we were recording one of the songs. Here's the video of our little recording session.</p><br>
