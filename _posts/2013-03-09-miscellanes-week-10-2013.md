<p>Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to                      share a variety of articles and posts and other            interesting         things  I     have seen and read across  the  web.   For        those who   don't   use      Twitter  but    are   interested   in      reading  or  perusing   the   links,   they    are    collected    here        and posted  at the  end  of  the   week.</p>

<li><a href="http://kuyperiancommentary.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/why-most-christians-should-use-facebook/" target="_blank"><strong>Why Most Christians Should Use Facebook!</strong></a> - We hear lots about why Christians should be wary of social media and of all the dangers associated with it, but it's not often that someone comes out and says Facebook is a valuable tool for Christians to use. <a href="http://twitter.com/uribrito" target="_blank">Uri Brito</a> does, though, and he has some really helpful thoughts on why it is useful and how to use it well.</li>
<li><a href="http://thecuratesdesk.org/2013/03/01/the-consolation-of-theology-or-why-we-need-scholar-priests/" target="_blank"><strong>The Consolation of Theology: Or Why We Need Scholar Priests</strong></a> - Here is a good post on the importance of doctrine and theology in ministry. The author writes, "We simply cannot offer any answer worth hearing if we do not have  priests trained to think theologically and who can delve into our  tradition in creative ways to answer complicated questions and profound  doubt."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/06/church-hypocritical-sex-guilty" target="_blank"><strong>The church may be hypocritical about sex, but is no one else guilty?</strong></a> - This is a great article from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright" target="_blank">Tom Wright</a> on the hypocrisy of the media in light of some of the recent sexual scandals in the Catholic Church.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.homeforgood.org.uk/" target="_blank">Home for Good</a></strong> - The <a href="http://twitter.com/EAUKnews" target="_blank">Evangelical Alliance</a> has launched it's campaign this week to encourage and support churches and Christians who want to foster or adopt children and help deal with the problem of children in care here in the UK. This is a great cause, and a very practical way Christians can work to help the vulnerable in our society. Visit the site, and prayerfully consider if you could be a foster carer or adoptive parent and provide a home for a child!</li>
