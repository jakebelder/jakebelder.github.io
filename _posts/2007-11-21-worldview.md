If you float around in the circles I do for a while – like maybe for a couple of hours, give or take – you are bound to hear this statement, or at least some variant of it:

<blockquote>
In the total expanse of human life there is not a square inch of which the Christ, who alone is sovereign, does not declare, 'That is mine!'
</blockquote>

These words of [Abraham Kuyper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Kuyper) encapsulate, in a simple and profound way, a worldview that I (unapologetically) align myself with. Jesus Christ is Lord of all, or He is not Lord at all (Romans 11:36).
