<p>This is the time of year when we frequently hear the familiar old Advent and Christmas hymns. '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Holy_Night">O Holy Night</a>' is one of those favourites. The song was first composed by a Frenchman named Adolphe Adam in 1847, based on a poem by Placide Cappeau. A Unitarian minister, John Sullivan Dwight, arranged the composition that we best know today in the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>The first verse of the song speaks of sin and the coming of Christ to bring redemption. In the original French, the verse goes as follows (the literal English translation is in parentheses):</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Minuit, chrétiens, c'est l'heure solennelle, (Midnight, Christians, it is the solemn hour,)<br>
Où l'Homme-Dieu descendit jusqu'à nous (When God-man descended to us)<br>
Pour effacer la tache originelle (To erase the stain of original sin)<br>
Et de Son Père arrêter le courroux. (And to end the wrath of His Father.)<br>
Le monde entier tressaille d'espérance (The entire world thrills with hope)<br>
En cette nuit qui lui donne un Sauveur. (On this night that gives it a Saviour.)</em>
</blockquote>
<p>What is notable about the original wording of the song is its emphasis on sin affecting the entire world, and that the world 'thrills with hope' at the coming Saviour. This emphasis carries over in the translation most common to English speakers, where the third line of the first verse says, 'Long lay the world in sin and error pining,' and the fifth line reads, 'A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I heard a group of people singing this hymn, but in place of 'world' they used the word 'soul.' This caught me off-guard, on the one hand, because it was different from the lyrics I knew so well. Much more significantly, however, to understand the redemptive work of Christ only in terms of its effect on our soul is to miss a crucial aspect of the salvation Jesus brings. God did not send his Son into the world only to ensure that those who believe in him would one day have their souls taken away to a disembodied eternity in a far-off heaven.</p>
<p>No, the biblical idea of redemption is far greater than that. In their book, <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/3687/nm/Drama_of_Scripture_Finding_Our_Place_in_the_Biblical_Story">The Drama of Scripture</a></em>, Mike Goheen and Craig Bartholomew note that God intended to redeem all of his creation:</p>
<blockquote>
When God set out to redeem his creation from sin and sin's effects on it, his ultimate purpose was that what we had once created <em>good </em>should be utterly restored, that the whole cosmos should once again live and thrive under his beneficent rule. In Jesus Christ that goal of cosmic redemption was first revealed and then <em>accomplished</em> (207).
</blockquote>
<p>Israel's longing for the Messiah was a longing for the one who would defeat sin and death and bring his Kingdom to rule over all of creation. No less is this our hope for today. We know that in Christ's death and resurrection, the promises of the covenant are guaranteed, but we wait with longing for his return and the consummation of his Kingdom. We too long for the day when he returns to restore his creation, and&mdash;to borrow an oft-quoted phrase from N.T. Wright&mdash;he sets the world to rights. We await the coming of the New Jerusalem, when all God's people will be gathered together to worship the sovereign King and live in a renewed and glorified creation where everything is as God intended it to be.</p>

This is what the holy night long ago in Bethlehem was all about&mdash;the Incarnate God coming to bring a redemption that extends as far as the curse is found. If it is anything less, we have no reason to join in echoing the weary world's thrill of hope.
