Every week I use <a href="http://twitter.com/jakebelder">Twitter</a> to share a variety of articles and posts and other interesting things I have seen and read across the web. They are then collected here and posted at the end of the week.

Here are the links from the week of <strong>16-22 March 2014</strong>:

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1gFAtBr">Mark Driscoll Retracts Bestseller Book Status, Resets Life</a></strong> – Driscoll has been in the news a lot lately, and not for the best reasons. It seems from some of the things coming out now he might be starting to recognise some of the problems that need addressing. If what this post says is true, then it's a good first step.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1qYTjf2">The holiness of housework</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1qYTjf5">The holiness of the ordinary</a></strong> – <a href="http://twitter.com/PastorSteveJeff">Steve Jeffrey</a> offers some short quotations from Martin Luther and John Calvin on a theology of vocation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1iln992">The Importance of Infant Baptism</a></strong> – Two quotes here from Pierre Marcel and John Calvin, neither of whom, like many evangelicals today, had any problem making a bold case for infant baptism.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1ghKn1j">On this day, 458 years ago, Archbishop Cranmer was martyred</a></strong> – Friday was the anniversary of Thomas Cranmer's martyrdom, and in commemoration of that day, the pseudonymous blogger, <a href="http://twitter.com/His_Grace">Archbishop Cranmer</a>, has some thoughtful reflections.</li>
